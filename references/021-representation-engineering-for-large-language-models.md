Abstract
Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs.
Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly ma-
nipulates the model’s internal representations.
As a result, it may offer more effective,
interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models’ behavior. We present the first
comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to ad-
dress key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts
and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE
compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing
RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control.
We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, includ-
ing managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models’ performance.
Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological
improvements and construct a guide for best practices.

Introduction
Prompting and fine-tuning are common and effective methods for controlling the behavior of Large Language
Models (LLMs). But recently, a new paradigm for controlling LLMs inspired by interpretability research
has emerged: Representation Engineering (RepE). Instead of adapting the inputs or training the weights
towards outputs, Representation Engineering controls the LLMs’ behavior by manipulating its internal rep-
resentations. For this, it first identifies how a human-understandable concept is represented in the network’s
activations. Next, it uses that knowledge to steer the model’s representations, thus, controlling its behavior
(see Figure 1).
By tapping into models’ representations, RepE offers two main advantages: (1) Improve understanding:
RepE identifies how human-understandable concepts are represented in the models’ activation space; steering
that representation can verify whether the representation has the expected influence on the outputs. (2)
Control: RepE is promising as a powerful tool to control the behavior, personality, encoded beliefs, and
performance of an LLM, allowing us to make models behave in safe and desired ways. Since no training is
required, RepE can be cheaper, more data efficient, and more flexible to different users and situations than
other methods while causing less deterioration to the model’s performance.
Initial work on Activation Steering (Turner et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023a) was built on the assumption that
concepts are represented as linear directions in the activation space of LLMs (Park et al., 2024b). These
methods focused on the difference in activations for inputs that are positive or negative with regards to the
concept. They identify a vector that captures the model’s representation of a concept and can be added to

the activations on new inputs to modulate the intensity of the concept. Since then, a range of new RepE
methods have been proposed. For example, such methods identify representations by finding interventions
that lead to desired outputs (Cao et al., 2024a) or learning internal features in an unsupervised fashion
(Templeton et al., 2024). They go beyond static and linear representations (Qiu et al., 2024) by employing
different operators than a vector (Postmus & Abreu, 2024). And they experiment with new functions for
steering activations (Singh et al., 2024), as well as modifying the weights of the model by adding adapters
(Wu et al., 2024c).
However, the literature on RepE lacks an overview and there exist many unanswered questions and conceptual
confusions. In our work, we systematically answer the following questions.
• What is Representation Engineering?
We provide the first unification of different approaches
to RepE with a framework that describes them as pipelines that identify, operationalize, and control
representations.
• What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? We discuss and contrast different methods
for each step in this pipeline.
• How has RepE been applied? We describe how RepE has been applied to areas such as AI Safety,
Ethics, and Interpretability and show which concepts are more amendable to be controlled by RepE.
• How does it compare to other methods? We contrast RepE to related methods and provide a
meta-survey of comparisons between RepE and fine-tuning, prompting, and decoding-based methods.
• Why does it work? We suggest reasons why RepE works so effectively.
• What are strengths and weaknesses of RepE? We provide a list of advantages and challenges of
RepE.
• What opportunities for future research are there? We suggest broad themes and concrete ideas
for improvements and outline opportunities for strengthening the field.
To answer these questions we conduct a thorough literature review, collecting detailed information from
>130 papers. Although previous surveys on Mechanistic Interpretability (Ferrando et al., 2024; Bereska &
Gavves, 2024) and frameworks for causal interpretability (Mueller et al., 2024; Geiger et al., 2024a) have
touched on RepE, there is no dedicated survey of this research area. A survey is especially pressing since over
100 papers have been released within the last year without a systematization of the literature. In addition to
Activation Steering, we include methods that modify the weights, identify concept representations through
optimizing for outputs, and are not based on vectors. We focus on methods that apply control on intermediate
representations of a model without fully replacing them, thus excluding soft-prompting, decoding-based
methods, and Activation Patching. For a detailed description of the inclusion criteria and literature search
process, see Appendix B.

We conclude that future work needs to build ways to benchmark RepE methods to enable thorough compar-
isons. In addition, we identify opportunities in considering representations that are non-linear, multi-concept,
have interactions between layers or trajectories over time. Furthermore, there are a number of promising
directions for new applications, and improved concept identification and control methods. To make RepE
usable in practice, we will need to see improvements in its ability for multi-concept steering, long-form
generation, reliability, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness, and maintenance of general capabilities.

What is Representation Engineering?
Representation Engineering (RepE) is a class of techniques that: Manipulate representations of a model
in order to control its behavior with regard to a concept.
To achieve this, a pipeline with two steps is necessary: First, we identify how the targeted concept is
represented within the model. Secondly, we use that information to steer the model’s representations on
new inputs. In this context, a concept can be understood broadly as any human-understandable feature like
behaviors, tasks, entities, pieces of knowledge, or personality traits. RepE assumes that such concepts are
represented in LLMs. Representations are the internal structures or encodings that a model uses to capture
and process information about a concept.
The goal of Representation Identification is to produce a concept operator that accurately captures
the model’s representation of a concept. The concept operator is an object, for example, a vector, with a
specific intended relationship to the model’s actual concept representation. This bakes in assumptions about
the geometry and location of concept representations.
The concept operator is then used for Representation Control by steering the representations of the model.
For this a steering function is employed that uses the concept operator to manipulate the activations or
weights of the model. If the concept operator accurately reflects the model’s representations and the steering
function is effective, this will steer the model’s representations and, thus, control the outputs of the model.
RepE is also sometimes referred to as Activation Engineering or Activation Steering. However, we chose the
term Representation Engineering to emphasize that representations can also be controlled by modifying the
weights of a model.
2.1
Illustrative Examples
To illustrate RepE, we provide an example inspired by Zou et al. (2023a), where RepE is applied to make
an LLM give more truthful answers. To identify how truthfulness is represented, inputs are provided that
instruct the model to be honest or to lie. Next, the activations for these inputs are collected. Then, the
difference between activations for honest and dishonest inputs is calculated. This produces a vector that
denotes a direction in the activation space which represents honesty. This vector can be used to guide the
training of a LoRA module that generates activations more aligned with the truthfulness direction. This
effectively steers the model to give more truthful answers.
In another example inspired by Cao et al. (2024a), RepE is applied to align the outputs of an LLM with the
preferences of a human. For this, they find how activations need to be changed to lead to desired outputs.
Given a dataset of desired and undesired outputs, a vector is optimized that can be added to the activations
during a forward pass to make it more likely for the desired output to be generated. When processing new
inputs, that vector can be added to the activations, thus, steering the model towards human preferences.
2.2
Advantages of Representation Engineering
Sample Efficient. RepE can be effective with a low number of training examples (Wang et al., 2024a).
Furthermore, some RepE methods do not require a labeled dataset (see Section 7.1). These properties make
it easier and cheaper to employ RepE.
Flexible. The steering of RepE can be turned on or off flexibly. It is also possible to dynamically adjust
the steering per request, thus enabling personalization and context-dependent control (Cao et al., 2024a;
Stickland et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Lucchetti & Guha, 2024).
Low Impact on Capabilities. As shown in Section 10.2, RepE tends to not strongly degrade the ca-
pabilities of the model (Panickssery et al., 2024; Stickland et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Qiu et al., 2024;
van der Weij et al., 2024). Thus, it is possible to use RepE practically in production without sacrificing
model quality.

Precise Control. RepE offers direct control over the representations of a concept. This makes it possible
to apply precise steering at the granularity of single concepts.
Efficient During Inference. Methods for Representation Control come at a negligible increase in compu-
tational cost during inference (Li et al., 2023a). Most methods do not require a large number of additional
parameters, and none require additional inference steps.
Causally Verifiable Interpretability. By observing the effect of steering a representation on the output,
we can verify that the identified representation causes the expected change (Marks & Tegmark, 2023; Arora
et al., 2024). This can make us more confident that the right representation for a concept was found.
Tacit Interpretability.
By giving users access to knobs they can turn to influence internal, human-
understandable representations, RepE can provide tacit understanding to non-expert users about the inner
workings of LLMs (Chen et al., 2024a).
Advantages over Other Methods. Our meta-survey in Section 10.2 indicates that RepE tends to be more
effective at controlling models’ behavior than alternative methods like prompting, fine-tuning, or decoding-
based methods.
Compatible with Other Methods. RepE can be used in addition to other methods for stronger control
(see Section 10.2). This enables the use of RepE in a defense-in-depth approach, where multiple imperfect
methods are combined to achieve strong safety guards.
Takeaway: What is Representation Engineering?
RepE manipulates the representations of a model in order to control its behavior w.r.t. a concept. This is
done by identifying how a concept is represented within the model and then using that knowledge to steer
the representations. It allows for effective, efficient, flexible, and precise control over models’ behavior
while largely retaining quality.

Framework and Notation
Building on the background and definitions in Section 2, we propose a framework that classifies RepE
pipelines based on the method they use for Representation Identification, Representation Control and how
they operationalize representations (see Figure 2). Additionally, we provide a unifying formalization of RepE
that showcases the function signatures of the steps of RepE pipelines. For an overview of the notation, refer

is used to identify a concept operator.
Representations are operationalized by assuming a geometry of
representations. The concept operator is used to steer the weights or activations of the model.
3.1
Representation Identification
Representation Identification (RI) is the first step in the RepE pipeline. It aims to find out how the concept
is represented in the LLM’s activations. For this, an RI method needs to provide a stimulus related to the
concept, collect the model’s activations, and calculate the representation of the concept from the collected
activations. The result is a concept operator that denotes the model’s representation of the concept.

## Page 8

Definition 1. Representation Identification RI is a method
RI(M, S) →oc
that takes
• a model M
• a set of strings S that have a positive, negative, neutral, or an unknown relationship to the concept:
S = Sc+ ∪Sc−∪Sc∅∪Sc?,
and returns a concept operator oc that denotes the concept’s representation.
Methods for Representation Identification need to carry out three steps.
First, they need to provide a
stimulus related to the concept.
These are strings used as inputs or ground-truth outputs that have a
positive, negative, neutral, or unknown relationship to the concept. This means that they exemplify or
contain the concept, serve as counterexamples to the concept, are unrelated to the concept, or that their
relationship to the concept is unknown. This relationship is usually predefined by humans, e.g., as labels
in a dataset. However, in some cases, it is evaluated dynamically during the execution of the method. It
is important that these strings actually activate the desired concept’s representation, so it is present in the
activations. Secondly, they collect activations of the model related to these strings.
Definition 2. The activation collection function Act
Act(M, Xc, l, m, p) →Ac
l,m,p
extracts activations of model M for inputs X at layer l, model component m, and token position p
Crucially, our knowledge about the strings’ relationship to the concept lets us infer whether the concept
representation is present in the activations for that input. Thirdly, they calculate the concept operator from
these collected activations. This can range in complexity from a simple arithmetic operation to a large
training run.
There are three broad categories of approaches to Representation Identification. Methods that employ Input
Reading provide inputs related to the concept, read out their activations, and then calculate the operator from
the resulting sets of activations. Those that do Output Optimization utilize a way of scoring outputs with
regard to the concept to optimize the activations accordingly. A concept operator can then be derived from
the optimized activations. Finally, other methods employ Unsupervised Feature Learning, where they first
learn internal features from activations in an unsupervised way. We can identify the feature corresponding
to the targeted concept by studying inputs and outputs related to that feature.
3.2
Operationalizing Representations
To be able to identify and control representations, RepE pipelines need to operationalize how the model
represents the concept. This introduces assumptions about the structure and geometry the model uses to
represent the concept in the activations. For example, concepts could be represented as linear directions in
the activation space (Park et al., 2024b) or as non-linear manifolds. Furthermore, a concept operator oc is
necessary to denote how the model represents the concept. oc results from the Representation Identification
step and is used in Representation Control. It can take various forms and differs in its intended relationship
to the model’s actual representation of the concept.
3.3
Representation Control
Representation Control (RC) is the second step in a RepE pipeline. RC methods should steer the represen-
tation of a concept in order to control the model’s behavior w.r.t. that concept. For this, they employ a
steering function F that uses the concept operator oc to modify the model’s activations or weights. While
F only describes a mathematical operation, RC encapsulates the whole process of where, when, and how F
is applied. Employing RC should result in controlled outputs yc that are more aligned with the concept c
than an originally uncontrolled output yorg.
8

## Page 9

Definition 3. Representation Control RC
RC(F, oc, M, x) →yc
applies the steering function F and concept operator oc to control the representations of model M on inputs
x. This leads to outputs yc that have been controlled with regard to c.
To steer the representations of a model, we can either modify its activations during inference or adapt its
weights. Activations of unseen inputs can be adapted during inference by shifting them using the concept
operator.
Definition 4. An activation steering function
F a(al, oc
l ) →ac
l
adapts the activations al at layer l, using oc
l to attain the steered activations ac
l .
In addition, we can modify weights to steer the activations they output in desired ways.
Definition 5. A weight steering function
F w(wl, oc
l ) →wc
l
modifies the weights wl using oc
l so that
wc
l (al−1) →ac
l
the modified weights wc
l produce steered activations ac
l .
Some steering functions apply simple operations, while others require retraining of the model. Furthermore,
some RC methods are adaptive to the present context, while others always apply the same effect. Weight
steering functions only need to be applied once, while activation steering functions need to be applied
repeatedly on every new input. Notably, the line between activation and weight steering functions can be
blurry. For example, in an MLP layer, adding a steering vector to the activations is equivalent to adding it
to the bias term.
Takeaway: Framework & Notation
RepE is a 2-step pipeline:
1. Representation Identification finds a concept operator that denotes the model’s representation
of the concept.
2. Representation Control applies a steering function that uses the concept operator to modify
the activations or weights of the model.
Further, RepE pipelines make assumptions about representations to operationalize them into a concept
operator.

Representation Identification
Representation Identification (RI) aims to find a concept operator that denotes how the model represents
the target concept in its activations. Methods can be based on Input Reading, Output Optimization, or
Unsupervised Feature Learning. This section separately dives into these categories and identifies differences
of methods within the categories.
4.1
Input Reading
RI methods that fall into the Input Reading category provide inputs related to the concept, read out their
activations, and finally calculate the operator from the resulting sets of activations.

4.1.1
Constructing Inputs
Input Reading methods aim to activate the concept representation by providing inputs S that are related
to the concept. To do that, one needs to attain a relevant dataset, divide it into groups that differ in their
relation to the concept, and put the inputs into a prompting format that successfully activates the concept’s
representation.
Source of Inputs. The data can be gathered from an existing dataset, manually created, or syntheti-
cally generated. A majority of papers use existing datasets like TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) or ToxiGen
(Hartvigsen et al., 2022). Researchers can use the labels in the dataset to separate examples into different
groups. Multiple papers also use manually created datasets (Li et al., 2024b; Marks & Tegmark, 2023), which
require human effort but may allow for more flexible and rigorous experimentation. Furthermore, it is also
possible to prompt an LLM to synthetically generate the inputs. This is an efficient and flexible approach
that allows targeting concepts for which no dataset exists. However, one might introduce confounders based
on the LLM’s biases and errors.
Relationship to the Concept. Typically, inputs are divided into multiple sets that differ in their relation
to the concept. Inputs can be positive sc+, negative sc−, or neutral sc∅if they exemplify or contain the
concept, serve as a counterexample, or are unrelated to the concept, respectively. Inputs can be classified
based on whether they mention a certain topic, e.g., by checking for wedding-related keywords (Turner et al.,
2024) or containing a specific word (Makelo et al., 2025). More abstractly, inputs can differ in whether they
exemplify a concept, e.g., being written in a specific style (Konen et al., 2024). Lastly, inputs can be divided
based on the model’s response to them, like classifying inputs based on whether the model answers them
correctly (Yang et al., 2024; Højer et al., 2025).
Prompting Template. Next, the inputs are often formatted into a prompt that activates the concept’s
representations. Multiple papers use an A/B-choice format consisting of a question, two answer choices
designated with “A:” and “B:”, and the letter corresponding to the answer (Panickssery et al., 2024). Here,
it is important to randomize the order, to not introduce the letter or position as a confounder. Another
common template adds pre-prompts to a question that instruct the model towards or against the concept
(Zou et al., 2023a).
Differences Between Contrastive Sets. Some methods construct contrastive pairs of inputs. These are
derived from the same example but transformed into two contrasting inputs. For example, one can use the
same question but attach a different pre-prompt (Zou et al., 2023a) or answer to it (Panickssery et al., 2024).
Deng et al. (2025) employ a matched pair trial design where pairs of inputs differ only in the roles assigned
to them and are guaranteed to lead to opposite behaviors. In other methods, the positive and negative
inputs are unrelated to each other since they are not derived from the same example (Wu et al., 2024c; Xu
et al., 2024b; Beaglehole et al., 2025). Generally, contrastive pairs are preferable since they better isolate the
10

## Page 11

target concept from other factors that could differ between the sets of inputs. However, for some settings,
contrastive pairs can be harder to obtain.
4.1.2
Collecting Activations
The provided inputs are fed into the model to perform a forward pass for which the activations
Act(M, Xc, l, m, p) →Ac
l,m,p are recorded at a specific layer l, model components m, and token positions p.
It is possible to find the best options for these hyperparameters by testing the effectiveness of the resulting
concept operator (Arditi et al., 2024).
Layer. It is a common practice to collect the activations from all layers and subsequently compute a concept
operator for each layer. Alternatively, one can reduce computational cost by focusing on layers that are more
likely to contain the concept’s representation (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024).
Model Component. There are multiple distinct places within a transformer block at which activations
can be collected. The most common ones are the residual stream after the MLP or the attention layer, the
outputs of individual attention heads, and the outputs of an MLP or attention layer. Analyzing the MLP or
attention heads gives insight into the computations done at that layer, while focusing on the residual stream
is akin to analyzing the intermediate memory of a program.
Token Position. Some methods read the activations at a specific token position that has special significance
towards the concept, commonly, the last token (Scalena et al., 2024) or the end-of-sequence token (Rozanova
et al., 2023), the token containing an answer (Panickssery et al., 2024), or the token mentioning the concept.
Other methods collect activations for all tokens and then take their average to serve as a representation of
the sequence (Li et al., 2024e).
4.1.3
Calculating the Concept Operator
The activation collection step results in sets of activations that have different relationships to the concept.
These can be used to calculate the concept operator. Assuming that we are given a positive and a negative set
of activations A+
l,m,p, A−
l,m,p with n samples each, we need a function f(A+
l,m,p, A−
l,m,p) →oc
l,m that calculates
the concept operator.
Difference in Means. Taking the difference between the classes of activations can identify the direction
that captures their differences. Difference-in-Means (DiM) is a popular method that simply calculates the
average for both classes and subtracts the negative from the positive one (Panickssery et al., 2024; Jorgensen
et al., 2024; Ball et al., 2024). This is equivalent to taking the average of the difference between pairs of
examples oc = 1
n
P
a+,a−∈A+,A−a+ −a−. Earlier papers took the difference between a single pair of inputs
(Turner et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), however, it has been found that taking the difference across larger
datasets leads to higher-quality operators (Chu et al., 2024; Jorgensen et al., 2024). Arora et al. (2024)
employ an unsupervised method that discovers 2 clusters of activations through k-means and subtracts their
means. Im & Li (2025) show that DiM is optimal at identifying a vector that matches negative examples to
positive ones. However, these vectors are not suited to steering positive examples where they lead to large
performance reductions.
Probes. Probes are classifiers that predict whether activations belong to the positive or negative class
fθ(a) →{c+, c−}(Alain & Bengio, 2018). The weights θ of a probe should capture the concept’s repre-
sentations. Many papers employ logistics regression classifiers as probes and use the learned weight vector
as the concept operator (Chen et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a). Contrast Consistent
Search identifies a linear probe that retains logical consistency P(c|xi) = 1 −P(not c|xi) (Burns et al.,
2023). Others train multiple orthogonal probes and combine them through a weighted sum (Chen et al.,
2024b). Multiple papers use MLP-based probes, which are more expressive (Hoscilowicz et al., 2024; Singh
et al., 2024). Wang et al. (2024c) use k-means clustering on the difference between positive and negative
pairs to then train one linear probe per cluster, thus discovering multiple aspects of the concept. Xu et al.
(2024b) find a vector that can be added to activations to prevent a linear probe from detecting the concept.
However, Im & Li (2025) critique that probes only capture the direction and not the magnitude necessary to
match positive and negative examples. Beaglehole et al. (2025) train a probe that learns non-linear features
11

## Page 12

from the activations, before deriving a matrix that captures the directions in activation space to which the
probe is most sensitive. The top eigenvectors of these matrices are then used as concept operators. Lastly,
Nguyen et al. (2025) train concept vectors to match the negative to positive activations distribution using a
Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss that captures higher order differences in distributions like variance.
Dimensionality Reduction. Dimensionality Reduction techniques can help to identify the most important
information about the concept.
It is common to apply Principal Component Analysis to the difference
between the two sets of activations PCA(A+ −A−) = λ1, λ2, ... before selecting the first principle component
as the concept operator oc = λ1 (Zou et al., 2023a; Adila et al., 2024b). However, the direction with the
highest variance does not necessarily capture the shift between positive and negative examples (Im & Li,
2025). Other papers use Singular Value Decomposition to identify the most important components of each
group of inputs (Adila et al., 2024b), their difference (Tlaie, 2024; Ma et al., 2025), or their covariance
matrix (Qiu et al., 2024). Xiao et al. (2024) criticize that dimensionality reduction techniques lose crucial
information and instead train a Gaussian Mixture Model to model the distribution of positive and negative
activations.
Additional Techniques. In addition to these techniques, multiple papers attempt to identify neurons or
attention heads which are more relevant to the concept and then only calculate the operator from those. The
idea is to find a minimal steering intervention that causes fewer side effects by assuming that the concept’s
representation is only encoded in the selected neurons. Li et al. (2023a) and Ma et al. (2025) only intervene
on the attention heads where a probe achieves high accuracy, and Todd et al. (2024) focuses on attention
heads that have a causal effect on a specified task. Other papers find important neurons by calculating
attribution scores per neuron (Wu et al., 2024b), by selecting ones that exhibit low variance on the difference
between sets (Li et al., 2024c) or by identifying causally influential nodes through Activation Patching (Xiao
et al., 2024). Another technique first projects activations into a different space before deriving an operator.
For example, Zhang et al. (2024b) train an autoencoder that projects activations into a space where they
are easily separable.
4.2
Output Optimization
Representation Identification methods that perform Output Optimization provide information about the
concept by scoring outputs.
This is done by first providing inputs and collecting their activations and
outputs. Secondly, a loss function is constructed by evaluating the outputs with regard to the concept.
Thirdly, an optimization algorithm is used to iteratively optimize the activations to achieve a high concept
score.

Identification.

4.2.1
Collecting Activations
Output Optimization methods provide some inputs X and collect the resulting activations that will be
optimized Act(M, Xc, l, m, p) →Ac
l,m,p at a specific layer l, model components m, and token positions p.
Source of Inputs.
Inputs X can be taken from existing datasets (Wu et al., 2024c), or be generated
manually or synthetically (as in Section 4.1.1). While they do not need a specific relationship to the concept,
they are usually meant to produce outputs that are relevant to the concept. The inputs can be a query (Yin
et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2024a; Zeng et al., 2024) or a sentence that the model should transform (Subramani
et al., 2022; Konen et al., 2024).
Layers, Model Components, and Token Positions.
Next, the activations of the model that will
be optimized are chosen. Activations are usually collected at every layer from the attention heads, residual
stream, or MLP or attention layer outputs. However, some papers focus on attention heads for which a linear
probe achieves high accuracy (Yin et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024). Furthermore, we need to decide at which
token positions the optimization will be applied. While some papers only focus on the activations during
generation (Konen et al., 2024), others use the activations on input tokens (Cai et al., 2024), a combination
of input and output activations (Wu et al., 2024c), or activations of tokens with specific syntactic relevance
to the concept, e.g. for the token naming a person (Hernandez et al., 2024).
4.2.2
Output Scoring
The model generates outputs M(X) →Y that are scored according to the concept Scorec(Y ), which is used
as a loss function LScore(Y ).
Output Format. Based on the input, we can let the model generate a single token (Hernandez et al.,
2024), a sentence (Subramani et al., 2022), or a long-form generation (Cao et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024a;c).
Scoring.
These outputs are now evaluated on how much they align with the concept.
This provides
information about the concept to the optimization process. The outputs can be evaluated by comparing
them to ground-truth answers from a dataset or through a scoring function. A score can be derived from
the log-probability the LLM assigns to the ground-truth token (Hernandez et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024c)
or sentence (Subramani et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2024) or from the difference in log-probabilities between a
desired and undesired answer (Cao et al., 2024a; Zeng et al., 2024). A scoring function can judge how much
an output aligns with the concept. Cai et al. (2024) ask an LLM whether the output is aligned with the
concept and use its token probabilities on “yes” and “no” as a score.
Loss Function. The score is then transformed into a loss function. The Cross-Entropy loss is popular
(Subramani et al., 2022; Konen et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024a;c). Yin et al. (2024) add a regularization term
to induce sparsity and Hernandez et al. (2024) additionally minimize the KL-divergence compared to the
unsteered token distribution to minimize unwanted side-effects. Other papers adapt previously developed
loss functions for preference optimization like DPO (Cao et al., 2024a) or ORPO (Zeng et al., 2024). Lastly,
Wu et al. (2025) suggest ReFT-r1, which optimizes a joint objective for the probing accuracy and steering
effectiveness of a concept.
4.2.3
Optimizing Activations
A concept operator is optimized to modify activations so that they lead to outputs that score highly on the
loss function oc = argminocLScore(M(F(A, oc)).
Optimization Algorithm. After we have attained a loss function with regards to the concept, we can
employ an optimization algorithm to adapt the activations to minimize that loss. The most common method
for this is using Gradient Descent with the AdamW optimizer (Subramani et al., 2022; Hernandez et al.,
2024; Yin et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024a;c). Cai et al. (2024) propose an iterative algorithm
that samples outputs before backpropagating to a steering vector that makes the highest scoring output
more likely.
13

## Page 14

Derive Concept Operator. The concept operator is optimized for the loss function using the optimiza-
tion algorithm, while the activations and weights are kept frozen. This concept operator should combine
information about the concept from different outputs so that it generalizes to unseen examples. For a set
of inputs and outputs, we can train one shared concept operator using SGD over batches of inputs and
evaluated outputs (Yin et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024c). Subramani et al. (2022) instead trains one concept
operator for each input. However, this concept operator fails to generalize to different inputs. (Konen et al.,
2024) overcome this by first deriving one concept operator per input before averaging them into a generalized
concept operator.
4.3
Unsupervised Feature Learning
Representation Identification methods that perform Unsupervised Feature Learning (UFL) first learn sparse
features in the model’s activations and then identify which concepts they belong to. This is done by first
collecting a set of activations, applying a learning algorithm that discovers features in the activation space,
and then identifying which human-understandable concept a feature corresponds to. In contrast to other RI
approaches, UFL methods do not set out to find one specific concept representation but identify a large set
of concepts from which concepts of interest can be chosen.
UFL methods. The dominant paradigm in UFL are Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) (Templeton et al., 2024;
Huben et al., 2024). They are motivated by the observation that a model represents more features than
it has directions, thus forcing the model to represent features in superposition (Elhage et al., 2022). SAEs
aim to disentangle these representations by learning a dictionary of monosemantic directions that represent
sparse concepts. This dictionary receives the LLM’s activations and is trained to accurately reconstruct
them while only using a small set of its features at a time.
Deep Causal Transcoding (DCT) (Mack & Turner, 2024a;b) attempts to find a minimal perturbation in the
activations of a layer that causes a large, predictable change in a later layer. As such, DCT might have
applicability for eliciting latent behaviors like backdoors or unknown capabilities.

Identification.

4.3.1
Collecting Activations
UFL methods provide inputs X and collect activations Act(M, Xc, l, m, p) →Ac
l,m,p at a specific layer l,
model components m, and token positions p.
Inputs. SAEs employ large datasets to collect many activations. The dataset does not have to be specifically
related to the concept of interest. However, SAEs require much larger datasets than other RI methods. This
inefficiency partially stems from the fact that SAEs learn many features, while other methods focus on a
single concept. DCT uses a much smaller set of inputs to collect activations. The inputs can be specific to
a domain or have wide coverage and do not require a specific relationship to the concepts of interest.
14

## Page 15

Location. The activations for SAEs are usually collected from the residual stream but have also been taken
from the outputs of the attention layers (Kissane et al., 2024) and MLP layers (Bricken et al., 2023). DCT
collects activations from the residual stream. DCT uses a much smaller set of inputs to collect activations
from the residual stream.
4.3.2
Discovering Features
An unsupervised learning algorithm is applied to discover features o in the activations A.
Goal. SAEs are trained to take the model’s activations, project them into a higher dimensional and sparse
space, and then project them back.
The goal is to disentangle the representations of concepts that are
superimposed on each other. Since the dimensionality of the SAE is much larger than that of the LLM, it
can represent each concept as a monosemantic direction while retaining the same information as the LLM.
The key idea of DCT is that perturbations along semantically meaningful directions at one layer will cause
large, consistent, and predictable changes at later layers, whereas the effect of meaningless perturbations is
inconsistent and quickly diminishes over the layers.
Loss. The SAE is trained to have a low reconstruction loss and to use sparse features. The reconstructed
activations should be very similar to the original activations, and any feature in the SAE should only activate
on a few inputs.
In DCT, a set of vectors is optimized over a set of inputs so that adding them to the activations at an early
layer causes a large change in later layers. The vectors are optimized to have effects that a shallow MLP
model can predict with high accuracy. Furthermore, orthogonality between vectors is enforced to find a
diverse set of features.
Learned Objects. SAEs learn an MLP that projects from the LLM’s activations into the SAE space and
one MLP that projects back.
The directions in the SAEs space can be seen as features in this learned
dictionary. Ideally, they should denote representations of concepts within the LLM and can be used as
steering vectors. DCT produces vectors that can be added to the model’s activations to achieve specific
downstream effects. They can be used directly as concept operators.
4.3.3
Identifying Concepts
Lastly, one needs to identify which concepts c the learned features o correspond to, thus deriving the concept
operator oc.
This requires a method for identifying the features and a source of information about the
concept.
Identification.
One can inspect the inputs and outputs on which the feature activates most strongly.
However, Durmus et al. (2024) find that the context in which a feature fires does not always predict its
effect. Alternatively, one can increase the value of the feature and observe the effect on the model’s outputs.
Other methods identify feature directions that have a high mutual information with the target concept (Zhao
et al., 2024), optimize a collection of features to lead to desired outputs (Kharlapenko et al., 2024), or select
the features with the highest probing accuracy for a concept (Wu et al., 2025)
Labels. Early works viewed highly activating inputs and outputs manually to determine the corresponding
concept. Current work leverages automated interpretability by using LLMs to make these judgments. Other
methods require a pre-existing dataset labeled for the concept. For example, Wu et al. (2025) build a dataset
of positive and negative examples for a concept to determine the probing accuracy of features.
4.3.4
Applying SAEs
Once one has used SAEs to identify a feature that represents the targeted concept, the direction of that
feature can be used as a concept operator. However, using that concept operator for steering requires one
to translate every activation into the SAE space and back. Therefore, there have been attempts to use
SAE features to improve steering vectors in the LLMs activations that were identified by other methods.
Chalnev et al. (2024) derive steering vectors that activate desired SAE features. Conmy & Nanda (2024)
15

## Page 16

decompose a steering vector into SAE features and remove features that seem unrelated to the desired
concepts. However, this is challenging, as the steering vectors fall outside of the SAEs training distribution
and contain negative feature directions which are not accommodated in the SAE (Mayne et al., 2024).
Kharlapenko et al. (2024) address this by optimizing the SAE reconstruction of the steering vector to
achieve good downstream performance while incentivizing sparsity, leading to cleaner reconstructions.
Notably, SAEs have recently been extended to discover circuits of features implemented over adjacent layers
(Dunefsky et al., 2024) or multiple layers (Lindsey et al., 2024). Furthermore, there has been continued
progress for better SAE architectures (Rajamanoharan et al., 2024a;b). This progress will hopefully lead to
better methods for identifying and steering LLMs.
Many human-understandable concepts, such as famous people or scam emails, have been identified through
SAEs (Templeton et al., 2024). However, the method does not guarantee to find a specific concept of interest.
An engineer might be interested in the representation for honesty but fail to find one in the SAE. Furthermore,
while many papers motivate SAEs with the ability to steer representations, few of them actually evaluate
whether the discovered features allow for effective Representation Control. To improve the applicability of
SAEs for feature steering, it should be a standard to evaluate the effects of features on models’ outputs.
Takeaway: Representation Identification
To identify the representation of a concept, methods need to provide a stimulus related to the concept,
collect the model’s activations, and calculate a concept operator from them. There are three types of
methods:
1. Input Reading: Construct sets of inputs related to the concept, collect their activations, and
calculate the concept operator from the sets of activations.
2. Output Optimization: Collects activations and outputs, scores the outputs according to the con-
cept, and optimizes a concept operator for that score.
3. Unsupervised Feature Learning: Collect activations, discover features in the activations with an
unsupervised learning algorithm, and identify which concepts the features correspond to.
5
Representations Operationalization
RepE assumes that the model represents the concept of interest in its activation space.
However, it is
unclear how exactly the model’s representations are structured. RepE methods for identification and control
bake in assumptions about the geometry of representations used by the model. These representations are
operationalized in RepE methods with a concept operator that has a specific shape and intended relationship
to the models’ representation of the concept.

tation Identification step).

5.1
Assumed Geometry
Assumptions about the geometry of internal representations are included in the choice of RI method and
steering function. For example, if the weights of a linear probe are used as a concept operator, it will not be
16

## Page 17

able to pick up on non-linear aspects of a concept’s representation. Similarly, if an activation steering function
only increases along a linear direction, it would fail if the concept was represented along a non-euclidean
space.
There is an ongoing discussion in the interpretability community about the geometry that transformer models
use to represent internal features. The Linear Representation Hypothesis poses that concepts are represented
as linear directions in the activation space, and their intensity is denoted by the magnitude of the activations
in that direction (Park et al., 2024b). Although this hypothesis has some merits and, if true, would make
RepE easier, it has also been criticized (see section 11 for discussion). Thus, RepE methods with alternative
feature geometries have been proposed. They assume representations to be fuzzy, clusters (Postmus & Abreu,
2024), or non-linear manifolds (Qiu et al., 2024). Other possibilities for feature geometries include circles
(Engels et al., 2025), onions (Csordás et al., 2024), non-linear paths, or subsets of a vector space.
5.2
Concept Operators
The concept operator is the object that denotes the model’s representation of the concept. As the output
of RI and the input for RC, it is the linking element between the two parts of the RepE pipeline. Concept
operators can take different forms like vectors, matrices, or combinations thereof. Furthermore, they differ
in the relationship they are intended to have to the model’s representation.
Vectors. The most common type of concept operator is a vector oc ∈Rd, where d is the dimensionality of
the activation space. Often, this is used by methods that assume that representations are linear directions
in the model’s activation space, which a vector can describe. Thus, the concept operator vector should
be as similar as possible to that direction. Other methods follow Li et al. (2023a) and employ one vector
per attention head (Guo et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c; Li et al., 2024d). Furthermore, some methods
denote a concept representation through a set of vectors that represent different aspects of the concept
(Chen et al., 2024b) or serve different functions (Wu et al., 2024a). Cai et al. (2024) use a set of vectors that
were optimized to steer activations towards specific outputs to train a LoRA-adapter that produces similarly
steered activations.
Matrix. A range of matrices have been used as concept operators oc ∈Rd×d. Postmus & Abreu (2024)
operate on the assumption that features are fuzzy clusters in the activations. They use a positive semi-
definite matrix called a conceptor that should capture the principle directions and variances. This allows
to more precisely steer complex representations since conceptors also capture the underlying correlations
between activations. Xiao et al. (2024) two Gaussian Models that respectively model the distribution of
positive and negative activations. This retains information contained in the distribution of activations while
allowing activations to be mapped from one distribution to the other. Qiu et al. (2024) employ 2 matrices
that capture covariance with positive and negative activations, respectively. These matrices can be used to
project new activations to maximise their covariance with positive demonstrations and minimize covariance
with negative demonstrations. Lastly, Rozanova et al. (2023) learn a Nullspace Projection Matrix oc which
combines nullspaces that are orthogonal to the feature direction oca = (I −(oc
0, ..., oc
n))a →ac. This captures
information in the activations that a probe could use to predict the concept of interest. Thus, the matrix
can be used to project out information about the concept.
Matrix + Vector.
Some methods employ both a matrix and a vector to denote the concept representation,
most commonly to perform an affine transformation where the activations are multiplied with the matrix and
then added to the vector (Dong et al., 2024b). Singh et al. (2024) and Avitan et al. (2024) find that matching
the mean and covariance of negative and positive activations allows one to steer the model’s representations.
Thus, they derive a matrix that captures the covariance of the concept’s representation and a vector that
captures its mean. This allows to steer the representation with an affine function. Wu et al. (2024c) extend
this by learning an additional matrix that serves to project the activations in and out of a space where the
affine transformation is more effective. Hernandez et al. (2024) employ a matrix to amplify directions of an
attribute that are relevant to a concept entity and a bias term that better fits the transformed attribute
into the activations.
This assumes representations of entities and attributes to be represented linearly.
Alternatively, Pham & Nguyen (2024) assume that representations are directions of activations from the
origin and that the magnitude along that direction reflects the intensity of the representation. They use the
17

## Page 18

weights vector of a probe that separates the positive and negative regions in the activation space and an
MLP that can predict how to adjust the angle of an activation vector.
Takeaways: Representation Operationalization
1. Representaiton Geometry: RepE methods make implicit assumptions about the geometry of
representations.
Many assume that concepts are represented as linear directions, but alternative
perspectives exist.
2. Concept Operator: Most commonly, the concept operator is a vector denoting a linear direction.
Others use matrices to capture principled directions, covariances or all linearly available information
about a concept.
6
Representation Control
The goal of Representation Control (RC) is to steer the representations of the LLM in order to control its
outputs. For this, it employs a steering function that makes use of the concept operator to modify the
weights or activations of the model. Additionally, RC methods decide when and where to apply the steering
functions. The choice of concept operator oc and steering function F determine the effect of RC and bake
in assumptions about the geometry of model representations.
Throughout the section, we will describe the proposed steering functions along with the concept operators
they use. We describe what effect the steering function has on the activation space and how this is supposed
to control the representations of the model.
6.1
Modifying Activations
Activations can be controlled at inference time with an activation steering function Fa(al, oc
l ) →ac
l (see
Definition 4). For a given input, we read the activations at an intermediate layer al during the forward pass,
perform some operation F on it using the operator oc
l , and then use the modified activations ac
l as input for
the next layer. By steering the activations, we can control the model’s output with regard to the concept.

Activation Steering Functions
Linear Addition. This simply adds a vector oc ∈Rd to the original activations al + λoc
l →ac
l , where the
factor λ determines the steering strength. The model’s representation is assumed to be a linear direction,
and the concept operator is a vector that should denote that direction. Linear Addition simply increases
the magnitude of activation along the direction, which should increase the intensity of the concept in the
model’s representations.
18

## Page 19

Linear Addition is the most popular steering function.
Improving on this simple function, some papers
renormalize the activations after the addition to a normal magnitude, thus avoiding reductions in quality
(von Rütte et al., 2024; Adila et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2024b; Leong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b). Other
methods employ a set of vectors that are applied to individual attention heads (Li et al., 2024d; 2023a).
Following Differential Privacy, Zeng et al. (2024) adds noise to the vector to protect privacy.
Multiple papers attempt to add multiple steering vectors at once to steer multiple concepts or multiple
aspects of one concept. This can be done by simply adding all vectors at once (Wang et al., 2024c; Scalena
et al., 2024) or combining them in a weighted sum (Chen et al., 2024b; Zeng et al., 2024). However, this leads
to interference between concepts and increases negative impact on the LLM’s quality (see subsection 12.1).
van der Weij et al. (2024) avoid this by adding different vectors at different layers. Adila et al. (2024b)
decompose the different vectors into their orthonormal basis and use those for steering.
Vector Rejection. The vector oc can be rejected al −al·oc
l
oc
l ·oc
l oc
l →ac
l , by first projecting al onto oc
l before
subtracting. This removes the component of al that is parallel to oc
l , leaving us with the part of al that
is perpendicular to oc
l . Assuming linear feature directions, this removes the influence of the concept c in
the representations (Arditi et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2025). Equivalently, vector scaling al + al·oc
l
oc
l ·oc
l oc
l →ac
l
amplifies the components of the activations that are aligned with the concept operator (Chu et al., 2024).
Nullspace Projection. This employs a Nullspace projection matrix oc that captures information that a
probe would use to classify the concept in the activations. Multiplying activations with this matrix removes
the information of that concept oc
l al →ac
l (Rozanova et al., 2023), thus removing the influence of that
concept on the model’s outputs.
Soft Projection. This multiplies the activations with a conceptor matrix (discussed in Section 5.2) that
encodes the principal directions and variances of a concept set of activation vectors. This scales the acti-
vation vector along the directions relevant to the concept while not completely overwriting the non-concept
directions. Thus, it allows for a more nuanced control over representations (Postmus & Abreu, 2024).
Rotation.
Pham & Nguyen (2024) argue that rotating activations into the appropriate direction from
the origin is superior to shifting the direction directly since rotations achieve the desired direction while
retaining the magnitude of activations.
For computational efficiency, they approximate such a rotation
through a reflection followed by an adjustment of the angle. Undesired activations are reflected along a
hyperplane into the desired region of the activation space. Next, a learned MLP determines how to adjust
the angle of the reflected activations to attain the desired activation.
Affine Transformations. Affine Transformations for activation steering employ a matrix oc,M
l
and a vector
oc,v
l
to control the activation al through an affine transformation oc,M
l
al + oc,v
l
→ac
l . Singh et al. (2024)
apply affine steering to match the mean and covariance of two representations. They prove this as an optimal
steering function since it guards against linear probes for that concept, thus removing any linearly available
information about the concept. Similarly, Xiao et al. (2024) recenter and then rescale activations to fit
into the distribution of positive activations. Affine Steering has been used to manipulate facts the model
associates with an entity (Hernandez et al., 2024), project a steering vector into the activation space of
another model (Dong et al., 2024b), or to create counterfactuals with regard to sensitive attributes (Avitan
et al., 2024).
Projecting Before Editing. Another approach is to project activations into a space that allows for better
editing. Qiu et al. (2024) first project into a non-linear space, before they project activations into directions
that co-vary maximally with positive demonstrations and minimally with negative ones. Arora et al. (2024)
project different activations onto the feature vector to then subtract them without influencing other features.
In section 4.3 we discussed that SAEs can learn vectors that correspond to interpretable concepts. However,
these vectors are in the representation space of the SAE. If one wants to use them to steer the normal model,
it is possible to project the model’s activations into the SAE space, apply the steering on the feature of
interest, and then project them back. However, this comes with larger decreases in capabilities due to the
reconstruction error and at higher computational cost.

6.1.2
Location & Time
Layers and Components. Representation Control methods can modify the activations at different layers
or components. While some methods only steer the activations at a single layer and component (Panickssery
et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Cao et al., 2024a; Ball et al., 2024), others modify activations on many
or all layers and components (Konen et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024a; Adila et al., 2024a;
Qiu et al., 2024). The optimal location for steering can be found by measuring steering effectiveness (Zhang
et al., 2024a), probing accuracy (Zhang et al., 2024b), inspecting the projection of each layer’s steering vector
to the vocabulary (Cao et al., 2024b), or specific loss functions (Wang & Shu, 2023; Adila et al., 2024a).
Tokens. Furthermore, one could steer at different token positions. Some papers decide to steer at every
token position during generation (Bortoletto et al., 2024; Adila et al., 2024a; Wang & Shu, 2023). While this
can be more effective (Subramani et al., 2022), it also increases the impact on capabilities. Others only steer
at the last token of the query, hoping that the steering effects propagate throughout the generation (Wang
et al., 2024c; Adila et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024c). Some papers chose to steer at or before a token that gives
a prediction or answer (Paulo et al., 2024; Lucchetti & Guha, 2024).
Dynamic Activation Steering. For most activation steering functions, the intervention does not depend
on the input. This is suboptimal since some inputs might require different steering directions or strengths.
Dynamically adapting activation steering to the present context is an emerging theme within RepE since it
can increase steering effectiveness and reduce unwanted side effects.
Multiple papers decide whether steering is necessary for an input based on the cosine similarity between
the activations and the steering vector (Adila et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b), between the activations
and the average of steered activations (Ma et al., 2025) or depending on the output of a probe given the
activations (Stickland et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024d; Pham & Nguyen, 2024; Nguyen et al., 2025). Similarly, the
intervention decision can be made separately for each layer or component (Zhang & Viteri, 2024; Simhi et al.,
2024). Instead of a binary decision for intervention, other papers modulate the strength of the intervention.
This can be based on cosine similarity (Cao et al., 2024b), KL-divergence between steered and unsteered
output (Scalena et al., 2024), the L2-norm of positive and negative activations (Leong et al., 2023), or by
trying different strengths and evaluating the outputs (Fatahi Bayat et al., 2024). When multiple operators
are available, the weight assigned to each operator can be derived dynamically (Zeng et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2024c). Lastly, the operation itself can be dynamic, like using an MLP to predict the angle by which
the activations are rotated (Pham & Nguyen, 2024).
6.2
Modifying Weights
The representations of a model can be steered by modifying the weights with a weight steering function
F w(wl, oc
l ) →wc
l .
6.2.1
Training Weights
The weights can be modified through fine-tuning. This training is either aimed at producing desired activa-
tions or optimizes for specific outputs. Furthermore, fine-tuning methods differ in which weights or adapters
they train.
20

## Page 21

Training Towards Desired Activations. Weights wl can be trained to produce desired activations ac
l
by a weight steering function. A dataset of desired activations can be gathered by applying an activation
steering function Fa(al, oc) →ac
l .
Zou et al. (2023a) optimize a low-rank adapter (LoRA) to generate
activations with low L2-distances to steered activations. Similarly, Cai et al. (2024) train a LoRA adapter
on a dataset of optimally steered activations so that the resulting activations are similar to the optimally
steered activations. Alternatively, Zhang et al. (2024c) design an Adversarial Training setup where a LoRA
adapter is trained to generate activations that a discriminator classifies as aligned with the concept.
Training Representations without a Concept Operator. Some weight steering functions do not rely
on a concept operator oc. Instead, they train weights to produce activations similar to random noise. Zou
et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024b); Rosati et al. (2024) fine-tune an LLM so that activations on harmful inputs
or information that should be unlearned are close to noise. This should remove harmful representations from
the model.
Training Towards Desired Outputs. Multiple methods propose to fine-tune a small number of added
parameters towards a dataset of desired outputs. Wu et al. (2024c) propose ReFT, which trains an adapter
to bring the activations into a subspace where a linear projection and addition are applied. Yin et al. (2024)
fine-tune only the bias terms of selected attention heads. Wu et al. (2024a) train an adapter consisting of
a scaling and a bias vector. While these methods are inspired by RepE and aim to control the model’s
representations, they are also end-to-end parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA adapters (Hu
et al., 2022). This is shown by Jiang et al. (2024b), who draw a theoretical connection between LoRA and
ReFT and unify them into a meta-algorithm for model efficient fine-tuning. This highlights that weight
steering functions that optimize for specific outputs can be seen as being on a spectrum between RepE and
fine-tuning.
Training Towards Desired Activations and Outputs. Other methods optimize both for desired ac-
tivations and desired outputs. Ackerman (2024) optimize weights to produce activations with high cosine
similarity to the concept operator vector while also retaining a low cross-entropy loss in the outputs. Yu
et al. (2024) repeatedly ablate the vector that represents refusal while training the model to refuse harmful
answers. This should force the model to learn more robust representations of that concept. Stickland et al.
(2024) mitigate performance loss by training a LoRA adapter that minimizes KL-divergence in outputs when
a steering vector is applied to the outputs of the original unsteered model.
6.2.2
Editing Weights
It is also possible to edit the weights directly without training. Arditi et al. (2024) apply weight orthogonal-
ization wl −oc
l ocT
l wl →wc
l to the MLP weight matrix that writes to the residual stream. This modifies the
component weights to never write in the direction oc
l . If oc
l captures the direction with which the model rep-
resents a concept, this operation removes the concept from the model’s representations. Wang et al. (2024a)
simply add the weights of a probe oc to a few selected row vectors within the gated projection matrix of
the MLP weights. This shifts activations in the hidden state of the MLP away from undesirable regions and
towards desirable regions.
Takeaway: Representation Control
Representations can be controlled by steering the activations or weights.
1. Activations can be steered during inference by addition, rejection, or projection, thus increasing,
removing, or adapting the concept representation. Activation steering can be applied at different
tokens and dynamically adjusted for new inputs.
2. Weights can be steered by training them to generate desired activations and outputs or by editing
components of weight matrices.

Practical Representation Engineering Pipelines
In this section, we describe some prototypical RepE pipelines and classify how they fit into our taxonomy.
We compare them according to selected criteria. In addition, we gather empirical evidence to answer which
design choices in RepE work best.
7.1
Prototypical RepE Pipelines
In Table 8, we classify RepE pipelines according to which strategy they employ for Representation Identifica-
tion, the shape of their operator, and whether they control activations or weights. We score Representation
Identification methods on whether they require a dataset labeled according to the concept and whether
they require expensive optimization. Additionally, we score whether the method is restricted to linear rep-
resentations or can capture non-linear ones. Furthermore, we score whether controlling the model requires
retraining of its weights and whether the operation to control the model is dependent on the given inputs.
Lastly, we determine the types of concepts the method was initially designed to engineer. However, this
does not mean that they are not able to engineer other concepts. We select these RepE pipelines to show a
diversity of approaches while preferring highly-cited papers that were published at top conferences.
Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). CAA (Panickssery et al., 2024) provides positive and negative
examples of a behavior, collects their activations, and takes the mean difference between the 2 sets of
activations to calculate a vector. This vector is used as a concept operator that is added to the activations
during inference, thus steering the model with regard to high-level behavioral characteristics.
Low-Rank Representation Adaptation (LoRRA). LoRRA (Zou et al., 2023a) identifies the operator by
adding positive or negative pre-prompts to inputs, collecting their activations, and taking the first principle
component of the difference between the two sets of activations. Instead of directly adding the vector to the
activations, they train a LoRA adapter to output activations that are similar to adding the vector to the
original activations. This can steer a range of high-level concepts, including honesty, emotions, and ethical
values.
22

## Page 23

Inference-Time Intervention (ITI). ITI (Li et al., 2023a) inputs questions and answers that do or do
not correspond to the concept. Then, a linear probe is trained on the activations of each attention head to
predict whether the answer was or was not related to the concept. They select the attention heads with the
highest probing accuracy and use the weight vector of the probe as a concept operator. During inference,
these vectors are added to the activations of their respective attention heads. This method was first proposed
to make models more truthful.
Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE). SAEs (Templeton et al., 2024) are trained in an unsupervised fashion on
a large dataset of activations to learn internal features. Activations are projected into a wider feature space,
which is optimized so that features are sparse and can be used to reconstruct the original activations. We
can identify the concept a feature corresponds to by investigating inputs or outputs for which the feature is
highly activated. These features correspond to vectors in the embedding space of the SAE and can be used
to stimulate the model’s activations. SAEs find a wide range of concepts at different levels of abstraction.
Low-rank Linear Subspace Representation Finetuning (LoReFT). LoReFT (Wu et al., 2024c) learns
an adapter that intervenes with the activations during a forward pass.
The adapter first projects the
activations into a linear subspace, edits the activations with an affine transformation, and projects them back.
The outputs of the adapter are added to the original activations. For this, a low-rank matrix, projection
matrix and bias vector are trained to minimize the cross-entropy loss on a dataset that exemplifies the
concept. This method was proposed to improve performance on specific downstream tasks.
Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO). BiPO (Cao et al., 2024b) optimize a vector so that
adding the vector to the activations makes the desired outputs more and the undesired outputs less likely.
Subtracting the vector should have the opposite effect. After optimizing with Gradient Descent, we get a
vector that represents the preferences in the provided dataset. During inference, the model’s representations
are controlled by adding the vector to the activations. This was proposed to efficiently align LLMs with
human preferences.
Spectral Editing of Activations (SEA). SEA (Qiu et al., 2024) collects activations for a neutral question
and for corresponding positive and negative responses. By applying Singular Value Decomposition on the
covariance matrices between negative and neutral, as well as positive and neutral activations, they identify
a positive and negative editing matrix. During inference, they can select directions in the activations that
co-vary with the editing matrices and prune negative directions while retaining positive ones. They extend
this to non-linear directions by first transforming the activations into a non-linear space where the editing
can be performed before transforming the edited activations back. While SEA is not designed for particular
types of concepts, it was initially used to steer truthfulness and bias.
Minimally Modified Counterfactual (MiMiC). MiMiC (Singh et al., 2024) divides activations into a
positive and negative set based on an MLP probe trained to detect the concept. They then derive an affine
steering function that matches the mean and the covariance of the two sets of activations while causing
minimal distortion. On new activations, this function performs a projection and translation, steering it
towards the target concept while preserving key statistical properties. It was initially proposed to control
representations of toxicity and bias in sensitive concepts.
7.2
Which Methods Work Better?
In this section, we summarize previously reported results that compare different methods. While this section
gathers existing empirical evidence for comparison between RepE methods and implementations, we often
cannot make conclusive statements about the superiority of one method. This is because of a lack of unbiased
comparisons (see Section 13.5 for discussion).
7.2.1
What Works for Representation Identification?
Is it more effective to use Input Reading or Output Optimization? - Depends on the concept.
Multiple papers claim that their method based on output optimization improves on input reading methods
(Yin et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2024a; Ackerman, 2024). However, we lack evidence for the
contrary, which is likely because papers that propose input reading techniques did not compare their methods
23

## Page 24

to output optimization methods. Two unbiased comparisons find that an input reading method is better
at steering the sentiment of text (Konen et al., 2024) and that output optimization methods control the
concrete topics more effectively (Wu et al., 2025).
Are steering features from Sparse Auto-Encoders better than other RI methods? - Possibly a
combination.
In Zhao et al. (2024) and Makelo et al. (2025), an SAE-based steering is more effective than input-reading-
based RI methods. In contrast,Chalnev et al. (2024) find that an input-reading-based RI method leads
to more effective steering than SAE features. However, results in Chalnev et al. (2024) and Kharlapenko
et al. (2024) suggest that SAEs can be used to make input-reading-based concept operators more effective.
Finally, evaluations on the AxBench (Wu et al., 2025) find that SAEs perform worse at concept detection and
steering than LoReFT and class means but better than methods using probing or dimensionality reduction.
Which prompting format works best? - Unclear.
Braun et al. (2025) compare control effectiveness for seven prompt settings varying in whether an answer
token is appended, whether an instruction is prepended, and whether few-shot demonstrations are included.
While the setting that only appends an answer token has a slightly larger average control effectiveness, they
conclude that no prompt type clearly outperforms the other. Wang & Shu (2023) find that choice prompts,
where the model has to select answer A or B, outperform free-form answers. This is likely because the choice
prompt concentrates the relevant context into a single token and thus more effectively triggers the concept
representation. The lack of principled evaluations of optimal prompting formats for eliciting representations
makes this an important area of further study.
At which token positions should activations be read out? - Unclear.
Some evidence suggests that averaging the activations of multiple tokens is better than just using the last
token’s activations (Hoscilowicz et al., 2024). Furthermore, focusing on the last token given by the user can
be more effective than taking activations from an appended post-prompt like “I think the {attribute} of this
user is” (Chen et al., 2024a). Braun et al. (2025) do not find a clear difference between reading activations
at the last token of the question or at the token containing the answer.
Which function is best for calculating the difference between sets of activations? - Difference-
in-Means.
In Input Reading, functions like Difference-in-Means (DiM), linear probes, Principle Component Analysis,
or Contrast Consistent Search (Burns et al., 2023) are used to identify the concept representation from
contrasting sets of activations. This has been experimentally studied in 7 papers (Li et al., 2023a; Marks
& Tegmark, 2023; von Rütte et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a; Arora et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025; Im & Li,
2025). In 6 out of 7 papers Difference-in-Means leads to the strongest performance. The next best seems
to be taking the weight vector of a linear probe. PCA and CCS tend to perform worse. A fair comparison
between DiM, PCA, and classifier-based methods finds that DiM is best at positively and negatively steering
multiple-choice questions, equals the performance of probes at steering long-form generations, but leads to
the largest performance deterioration on positive examples (Im & Li, 2025). Lastly, Distributed Alignment
Search (DAS) (Geiger et al., 2024b) was only tested once in which it performed the strongest, highlighting
that DAS remains underexplored. Besides Input Reading, it is advantageous to apply mean-centering to the
steered activations as shown by Jorgensen et al. (2024).
7.2.2
What Works for Representation Operationalization?
Are matrices or vectors better concept operators? - Matrix more effective but more costly.
Multiple works that propose using matrices instead of vectors as concept operators find that they improve
steering effectiveness (Postmus & Abreu, 2024; Rajendran et al., 2024; Pham & Nguyen, 2024). Results from
Zou et al. (2023a) are more ambivalent, finding that a matrix slightly outperforms a vector-based concept
operator, but is clearly outperformed by a vector that is derived from additional forward passes for every
new input. While matrices can be more effective, they can also come at an increased cost (Postmus & Abreu,
2024) or reduced output quality (Rajendran et al., 2024).
Are linear or non-linear concept operators better? - Non-linear.
While most methods perform linear operations on the representations, the direct comparison between linear
24

## Page 25

and non-linear methods favors the non-linear ones. Non-linear Spectral Editing of Activations (SEA) out-
performs linear SEA (Qiu et al., 2024), and non-linear ITI is more effective than ITI, although this comes
at a higher cost in capabilities (Hoscilowicz et al., 2024).
7.2.3
What works for Representation Control?
Is it more effective to modify weights or activations? - Unclear.
This question is still open. Wang et al. (2024a) find that their method for controlling model weights is more
effective than intervening on activations while leading to a larger reduction in output quality. However, a
broader evaluation of that question is necessary.
Which steering function should be used for modifying activations? - Unclear.
Zou et al. (2023a) find that a piece-wise operation is more effective than linear addition. Chu et al. (2024)
find that projection outperforms a product, which again is more effective than linear addition. Luo et al.
(2024) find that linear addition is more effective than orthogonal projections at a higher cost in capabilities.
Linear addition remains the most popular activation steering function despite some other steering functions
outperforming it. This warrants further investigation comparing different operations. Krasheninnikov &
Krueger (2024) study different activation steering functions in a toy classification setup. They find that
more expressive steering functions have a higher performance ceiling and can control more complex tasks,
but simpler steering functions are effective with lower amounts of data.
At which token positions can activations be steered most effectively? - Apply steering at every
inference step.
Overall, it is more effective to continuously apply RepE at every inference step than to only apply it at the
first token (Subramani et al., 2022). This is because the steering effect diminishes throughout the generation
(Scalena et al., 2024). However, only intervening on the first token can still be very effective (Subramani
et al., 2022) and has a lower impact on output quality (Scalena et al., 2024).
Which component of the transformer should be steered? - Unclear.
RepE often modifies activations in the residual stream, the attention or the MLP block, but it is unclear
which component is most effective to steer. Existing evaluations only find that steering at the LM head or
embedding layer is ineffective (Subramani et al., 2022) and that steering both the attention and MLP blocks
is more effective than only intervening on one of them (Zhang et al., 2024b).
Should only one or many layers be controlled? - Many layers.
It is generally assumed that intervening on all layers at once leads to more effective steering at a higher cost
in the general capabilities of the model. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no experiments
proving this. Notably, many concepts can be most effectively steered in middle layers (Panickssery et al.,
2024; Im & Li, 2025).
8
What Concepts Can Be Controlled with Representation Engineering?
8.1
Types of Concepts
To illuminate how RepE can be applied, we cluster the concepts that have been controlled using RepE into
six categories of concepts. Table 9 showcases that most RepE papers steer high-level behavioral concepts
and that RepE can be successfully applied to all types of concepts.
High-level behavioral characteristics like harmfulness or honesty are the most popular category of
concepts controlled via RepE. These concepts are fairly abstract, may be context-dependent and cannot
easily be specified. They are in reference to the behavior exemplified by the model.
Tasks a model should carry out, including tasks like reasoning, classification and associations can be induced
by RepE. Such concepts specify an input-output function, for example, by finding a function vector that
triggers the execution of a task (Todd et al., 2024).
Language and style of a text, such as sentiment, style, genre, or language can be controlled with RepE.
Such concepts are high-level properties of the generated text.

Knowledge and beliefs encoded in a model about the world can be controlled with RepE. Such concepts
reference what the model assumes to be true while generating text. This includes changes to the model’s
factual knowledge or its situational beliefs (see Section 9.3).
Content of the model’s outputs are amendable to RepE, like steering it to focus on a specific topic and
contain or not contain some contents. These contents are often not exact text, but higher-level concepts like
“talking about weddings” or “social security numbers”. For example, the Concept500 dataset (Wu et al.,
2025) was designed for evaluating RepE and contains positive and negative examples for 500 concrete topical
concepts. Such concepts are properties of the generated text.
Values, goals, and ethical principles that are encoded in an LLM have been adjusted with RepE. This
refers to overarching objectives and principles according to which the LLM is making its decisions. It has
been applied to implementing human preferences into the LLM’s behavior (Cao et al., 2024a) or adapting
which ethical theories are used for decision-making Tlaie (2024).
Linguistic or grammatical features like verb conjugations or the gender of nouns are controlled in multi-
ple papers. Such concepts are specific to language, and their presence can easily be verified in the generated
text. While controlling them is not of great interest itself, they are used as a concept for interpretability (Hao
& Linzen, 2023) or to evaluate RepE methods (Arora et al., 2024).

Commonly Controlled Concepts
This section showcases concepts for which RepE has been applied most often. For this, we selected all steered
concepts in the surveyed papers. Table 10 shows the concepts which have been controlled in ≥5 papers and
how many of the experiments were successful or failed in steering that concept. Here, success is defined as
providing a significant improvement in the measure of the concept compared to the uncontrolled model.

The most common concepts are Truthfulness, Harmfulness, and Toxicity. This is because they are of practical
importance in the context of LLM chatbots and because RepE seems well suited to control them, but also
26

## Page 27

because early seminal papers experimented on these concepts and later work followed. Furthermore, we see
a very high success rate for all concepts. However, this statistic should be viewed critically since experiments
that fail to control a concept are less likely to be published. Nevertheless, it does provide evidence that these
concepts can be controlled effectively.
Takeaway: What concepts have been controlled with RepE?
There are different types of concepts that can be controlled with RepE, among which high-level behavioral
concepts like Truthfulness, Harmfulness, and Fairness are the most popular.

Applications of Representation Engineering
After describing some popular concepts that can be effectively steered with RepE, this section describes
concrete problems for which RepE has been applied.
9.1
AI Safety
AI Safety aims to prevent harm caused by or with AI models. In the context of LLMs this often refers to
preventing outputs that are harmful to the user, the use of LLMs for harmful applications, or untruthful and
hallucinated statements. We also include the prevention of private data leakage and the refusal behavior
of LLMs as safety concerns. Furthermore, the field studies threats of future advanced AI models such as
deception or self-improvement in current LLMs.
Reducing Harmfulness. Harmfulness is a broad category describing outputs that can cause some harm
to users, other individuals, or society. It includes more granular categories, such as toxic outputs, wrong
information, or private data leakage. To control harmfulness in general, one needs to identify and steer
harmful representations (Cai et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a; Scalena et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024; Beaglehole
et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2025).
This approach can be combined with other safety techniques such as
safe-decoding in a defense-in-depth approach (Banerjee et al., 2024). RepE can control harmfulness in multi-
modal LLMs (Wang et al., 2024b), and harmful representations identified in one language can be transferred
to another (Xu et al., 2024a). Furthermore, the effect of controlling the model’s exhibited personality traits
on the harmfulness of its outputs has been explored using RepE (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024; Zhang et al.,
2024a).
Toxicity is a more specific concept referring to offensive, aggressive, or inappropriate outputs. RepE has
been used to decrease toxicity (Wang et al., 2024a; Qian et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024;
Jorgensen et al., 2024; Pham & Nguyen, 2024; Li et al., 2024d; Turner et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024; Nguyen
et al., 2025). Concept operators for toxicity have been transferred from smaller to larger models (Dong et al.,
2024b). However, by increasing the intensity of the toxicity representation, RepE can also be used to make
models more toxic and induce attacks on LLMs (Wang & Shu, 2023).
A range of datasets are used to operationalize harm with AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023b), HarmfulQA (Bhard-
waj & Poria, 2023) and HarmEval (Banerjee et al., 2024) being among the most popular. RepE methods
tend to prevent harmful outputs more effectively than prompting or fine-tuning-based safeguards (Wang
et al., 2024b; Cao et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024c; Yu et al., 2024).
Preventing and Triggering Jailbreaking, Refusal, and Backdoors.
Training LLMs to refuse to
answer harmful requests is a key mechanism for ensuring that they do not produce harmful and toxic
outputs. To stress-test these safety mechanisms, jailbreaks have been developed that can circumvent this
refusal behavior (Yi et al., 2024). By directly manipulating the internal mechanism that triggers refusal,
RepE can serve as a very potent technique to avoid overrefusal or ensure that refusals are effective and
appropriate.
Wang & Shu (2023) were the first to show that adding a steering vector during inference undermines safety
by reducing truthfulness, making outputs more biased and increasing toxicity and harmfulness. This was
27

## Page 28

followed by a range of work that uses RepE to jailbreak models (Wang et al., 2024a; Ball et al., 2024; Xu
et al., 2024b; Stickland et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c; Tran et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024c).
Arditi et al. (2024) find that there is a single direction in the activations that mediates whether refusal
behavior is triggered or not. Yu et al. (2024) ablate the refusal direction while performing safety training,
forcing the model to learn more robust refusal behavior. Furthermore, RepE has been used to stop the LLM
from refusing to answer benign queries (Cao et al., 2024b; Xiao et al., 2024).
Lastly, RepE has been used to identify backdoors through UFL (Mack & Turner, 2024a) and trigger backdoors
by inducing the presence of the backdoor trigger (Price et al., 2024).
Making LLMs Truthful. A model is truthful if it outputs true answers. Getting models to give truthful
and honest answers is crucial for their performance, but it also increases the trust we can place in them.
Li et al. (2023a) were the first to steer truthfulness using a RepE method. Marks & Tegmark (2023) find linear
probes that can steer the model to treat false statements as true and vice-versa. Overall, RepE methods seem
to be particularly suited for steering this concept, often outperforming fine-tuning (Ackerman, 2024; Chen
et al., 2024b; Qian et al., 2024; Qiu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2024a) although it is sometimes
outperformed by prompting (Chen et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024c). The initial methods
have been extended to encapsulate multiple aspects of truthfulness (Wang et al., 2024c; Chen et al., 2024b),
steer non-linear representations (Hoscilowicz et al., 2024) or steer with different intensities before selecting
the most truthful output with a probe (Fatahi Bayat et al., 2024). TruthfulQA is the most commonly used
dataset (Lin et al., 2022).
Relatedly, hallucinations have been mitigated or induced with RepE (Wang et al., 2024c; Simhi et al.,
2024; Zhang et al., 2024b;c; Panickssery et al., 2024; Beaglehole et al., 2025).
Simhi et al. (2024) find
that hallucinations can be more effectively identified from activation before the model answers and more
effectively controlled in the activations of attention heads.
Increasing Privacy. LLMs are trained on large amounts of uncurated text from the internet that contains
private information, which could be leaked by the LLM.
To mitigate these privacy concerns, RepE has been used to prevent private data leakage (Zhang et al., 2024a;
Qian et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024). Wu et al. (2024b) find that securing specific private data can increase
the leakage of other private information, which they successfully suppress by controlling privacy-sensitive
neurons. Zeng et al. (2024) remove private information from the inputs and apply steering vectors to restore
performance. In the tested setups, these techniques can even improve over Differential Privacy methods
(Zeng et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024b).
Avoiding Future Risks. The AI Safety community has hypothesized future risks from advanced AI models,
and researchers are now attempting to study key aspects of these risks in LLMs.
A deceptive system could lie to humans about its intentions. While it is possible to make models more truthful
in general, Clymer et al. (2024) are not able to uncover and steer deception. However, sycophancy, which
is the tendency of LLMs to adjust their responses to what the user wants to hear, has been successfully
controlled (Stickland et al., 2024; Panickssery et al., 2024; Templeton et al., 2024), although others fail
to reproduce this (Paulo et al., 2024; van der Weij et al., 2024).
AI systems might develop misaligned
motivations, but this could be mitigated by engineering the representations of their goals (Mini et al., 2023).
RepE has controlled an LLMs’ exhibited desire for survival (Panickssery et al., 2024), power (Zou et al.,
2023a), wealth (van der Weij et al., 2024), and short-term rewards (Panickssery et al., 2024; van der Weij
et al., 2024). Furthermore, Panickssery et al. (2024) control corrigibility and willingness to coordinate with
other AIs against humans. Additionally, understanding the capabilities of a model is important for estimating
the risk it poses. Mack & Turner (2024a) propose a method that could elicit undiscovered capabilities through
unsupervised feature learning.

9.2
Ethics
Many ethical questions surround the development and application of LLMs. These include concerns about
societal biases and the fairness of models, aligning the LLM to the values of its users, and encoding ethical
reasoning into LLMs.
Improving Fairness. Since LLMs are trained on text from the internet, they are prone to encode and
amplify existing societal biases. An LLM might reproduce stereotypes, not be representative in its outputs,
or treat members from different social groups differently. By identifying how and where specific biases are
represented, RepE can aid in uncovering, showcasing, and mitigating such biases.
RepE methods have been used to identify representations of bias-sensitive attributes such as gender, age, or
race and control them to reduce the bias in outputs (Pham & Nguyen, 2024; Chu et al., 2024; Wang & Shu,
2023; Nguyen et al., 2025). RepE has been used to control the sentiment expressed towards social groups
(Luo et al., 2024) or how often a group is associated with a specific disease (Zou et al., 2023a). Singh et al.
(2024) identify representations for gender and dialect bias and removes the bias by steering all inputs to the
same gender or dialect class. Furthermore, Durmus et al. (2024) use SAEs to identify features for gender,
age, and political bias. They also find a “Neutrality” and “Multiple Perspectives” feature that reduce bias
across many dimensions of bias.
Additionally, RepE can be used to steer the representation of protected attributes to create counterfactual
outputs, which can surface biases and thus be used for auditing the model. Chen et al. (2024a) do this
by controlling the model’s belief about the user’s age, gender, educational level, and socioeconomic status,
thus uncovering how the model responds differently to different users. Avitan et al. (2024) intervene in
representations of gender to create counterfactual generations.
Commonly used datasets for identifying the representations of biases include BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021),
BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022), or BiasInBios (De-Arteaga et al., 2019) datasets.
Aligning with human preferences. Pre-trained LLMs do not necessarily act according to the preferences
and values of their users. To mitigate this, LLMs are commonly fine-tuned with methods like RLHF or DPO,
where humans give feedback to align the model with their preferences. Instead of fine-tuning the weights,
we could also use RepE to align with human preferences.
Cao et al. (2024a) train a steering vector using a DPO-based loss that makes it more likely for the model to
produce desired responses. It is also possible to use synthetically generated preference data to identify and
steer relevant models’ representations (Liu et al., 2023; Adila et al., 2024a).
Changing Ethical Reasoning. To aid in making LLMs act ethically, it is important they understand
human ethical reasoning developed over millennia.
RepE can help to improve general ethical reasoning
(Pham & Nguyen, 2024).
It can also steer the model towards specific moral theories like commonsense
morality, utilitarianism, or deontological reasoning (Tlaie, 2024; Zou et al., 2023a; Xu et al., 2024a).
9.3
Knowledge Editing
LLMs encode a wealth of knowledge in their representations. However, some of that knowledge might be
wrong, outdated, or dangerous. Thus, we would like to be able to remove and edit knowledge. Relatedly,
LLMs can encode certain beliefs about the world or other systems that can be useful to interpret and edit.
Editing Factual Associations. Model editing methods like ROME (Meng et al., 2022) have successfully
changed factual knowledge stored in LLMs. Similarly, Zou et al. (2023a) were able to make an LLM output
that the Eiffel Tower is located in Rome.
Hernandez et al. (2024) propose REMEDI, which can detect
and edit the attributes associated with an entity through its activations. Furthermore, it is possible to use
RepE to improve the ability of an LLM to reason with newly provided information (Yin et al., 2024). Zhao
et al. (2024) do not edit factual associations but rather control whether an LLM uses its learned parametric
knowledge or the contextual knowledge provided in the prompt to answer a question. Relatedly, it is possible
to detect and steer how much the model reproduces memorized text from the training dataset (Zou et al.,
2023a).
29

## Page 30

Unlearning. Unlearning is concerned with removing harmful or unwanted knowledge in a model. Li et al.
(2024b) propose Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU) that unlearns hazardous knowledge
by pushing harmful representations towards a random vector while retaining harmless ones. However, Xu
et al. (2024b) find that RMU and other unlearning methods are not robust against harmful steering vectors.
Farrell et al. (2024) use SAE steering to unlearn hazardous knowledge but find that it is not yet a competitive
unlearning method. Rozanova et al. (2023) are able to remove information about specific features. These
mixed results indicate that RepE might become a useful tool for unlearning but currently still has weaknesses.
Modulating Situational Awareness. During inference, LLMs may hold beliefs about the situation they
are currently in. These could be facts about the environment or other agents, which RepE can potentially
identify and control. Chen et al. (2024a) identify and control the models’ beliefs about the age, gender,
educational level, and socioeconomic status of the user it is currently interacting with. Similarly, Ghande-
harioun et al. (2024) control the model’s inferred impression of the user’s personas in order to elicit harmful
responses. Price et al. (2024) change what the model believes the current year is. Lastly, RepE has been
used to improve the model’s capability to reason about the beliefs of other agents in Theory of Mind tasks
(Bortoletto et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024).
9.4
Task Execution
Making LLMs carry out specific tasks is key to making them practically useful. This is usually approached
through fine-tuning on task examples, by providing few-shot examples, or by giving precise instructions.
Recently, RepE has also found applications to this by editing the representations to control which task is
executed in what way.
Todd et al. (2024) identify a function vector (FV) that captures an ICL task by finding attention heads that
have a causal effect on that task. In contrast, Liu et al. (2024b) find an in-context vector (ICV) from the
activations on contrastive few-shot prompting inputs. Brumley et al. (2024) compare these two methods and
find that ICVs are better able to steer behavioral tasks, while FVs control functional tasks more effectively.
Furthermore, FVs generalize better and deteriorate model quality less. Jorgensen et al. (2024) improve the
ICV methodology by adding mean centering and Li et al. (2024e) apply inner and momentum optimization
to the in-context vector. These works indicate that In-Context Learning partially works by shifting the
representations to the correct task. Additionally, it is possible to identify representations that trigger the
model to carry out Chain-of-Thought reasoning without being prompted to do so (Zhang & Viteri, 2024).
9.5
Controlled Text Generation
Controlled text generation involves generating text with specific attributes or constraints, such as sentiment,
style, or topic. The challenge lies in balancing the generation of coherent, natural language while maintaining
control over these characteristics. By shifting internal representations, RepE allows control over the desired
attributes.
Controlling Sentiment. Sentiment is the emotional tone or opinion of a text. Researchers have used RepE
to control how negative or positive the tone of generated text is (Turner et al., 2024; Konen et al., 2024) and
what emotions are expressed in it (Cai et al., 2024; Konen et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a). Commonly used
datasets are GoEmotions (Demszky et al., 2020) and the Yelp sentiment dataset.
Controlling Personality.
It is also possible to shift the personality traits exemplified by the model.
This can also indirectly influence other properties. Zhang et al. (2024a) steer personality traits of a model
according to the MBTI-scale and study the effects on its safety properties. Weng et al. (2024) are able
to steer the model towards OCEAN personality traits. By moderating the personalities, they are able to
improve reasoning, enhance conversational capacity, and reduce sycophancy. Furthermore, it is possible to
control the level of honesty and creativity displayed by the model with RepE (von Rütte et al., 2024).
Controlling Language, Style, and Genre. Guo et al. (2024) use input pairs from different languages to
improve coherence in cross-lingual information retrieval and Scalena et al. (2024) find that safety steering
vectors derived in English transfer to other languages. RepE can control the style of generated text, like
writing Shakespearean or Chinese text (Konen et al., 2024; Beaglehole et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025) and
30

## Page 31

its genre, like fantasy, sci-fi, or sports (Jorgensen et al., 2024). It can also steer generation towards specific
topics (Makelo et al., 2025; Templeton et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2024).
9.6
Performance
RepE has been applied to improve the performance of LLMs on general capabilities and specific tasks.
Improving Reasoning. Improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs is an important frontier in NLP research
to which RepE has been applied (Cai et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024c; Yin et al., 2024; Højer et al., 2025).
RepE has been used to identify the representations underlying the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism and
to control the model to produce CoT reasoning without being prompted to do so (Hu et al., 2024; Zhang
& Viteri, 2024). However, an attempt to steer the faithfulness of CoT reasoning with regard to the actual
decisions made by the LLM was unsuccessful (Tanneru et al., 2024). Additionally, RepE has been used to
improve social reasoning abilities (Bortoletto et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024).
Other Performance Improvements. The capability of LLMs for Natural Language Understanding and
Generation tasks has been improved through RepE (Wu et al., 2024c;a). van der Weij et al. (2024) use
RepE for improving the quality of general code and of python-specific code and Lucchetti & Guha (2024)
apply RepE to achieve type predictions that are more robust to irrelevant changes in the code. Furthermore,
RepE has been used to make the model provide equivalent answers for semantically equivalent queries (Yang
et al., 2024) and reduce its bias to the ordering of examples and answer options (Adila et al., 2024b). Guo
et al. (2024) improve the quality of a multi-lingual information retrieval system by steering for coherence
and accuracy. Lastly, Rahn et al. (2024) identify that uncertainty in the decision-making of an LLM agent
is related to the entropy of its activations, which can be steered to achieve better exploration behavior.
9.7
Interpretability
Interpretability aims to help humans understand the internal processes of AI models. RepE has helped to
identify how human-understandable concepts are represented and to study the impact of representations on
outputs.
Finding Linear Representations. If a linear vector detects a concept with high accuracy and controls
the concept effectively, this is evidence that this direction is how the model represents the concept. Thus,
researchers have claimed to find linear representations of concepts such as Truthfulness (Marks & Tegmark,
2023), Refusal (Arditi et al., 2024), models’ encoded beliefs about the current year (Price et al., 2024), subject
number for conjugations (Hao & Linzen, 2023), and Harmfulness (Xu et al., 2024b). These results also provide
some evidence for the Linear Representation Hypothesis (Park et al., 2024b). However, we should retain
appropriate skepticism about evidence provided by RepE about the linearity of concept representations (see
Section 12.2.1).
Other Insights. Aside from interpreting the shape of representations, RepE has been used to shed light
on many phenomena in LLMs.
Wolf et al. (2024) identify a trade-off between helpfulness and safety.
Qian et al. (2024) use RepE to
investigate how safety-critical concepts emerge throughout pre-training. Rozanova et al. (2023) study the
representations of safety concepts in different languages. They find them to be similar and see that English
safety concepts can be used to steer other languages. Other papers investigate the inner mechanisms of CoT
reasoning (Hu et al., 2024) and the impact of removing a concept (Rozanova et al., 2023).
However, RepE is not a perfect tool for interoperability, and results can easily be overclaimed. Wang &
Veitch (2024) specifically criticize the idea that editing representations at a location which leads to the
desired output change actually provides evidence that the concept representation is localized there. This is
because they see that optimal edits at random points are also very effective.

Representation Engineering outside LLMs
9.8.1
Image Generation
A large number of previous works studied controlling image generation by operating on learned represen-
tations.
Upchurch et al. (2017) showed that image editing can be done by linear interpolation in deep
feature space between images with a certain attribute and images without that attribute, given the hypoth-
esis that ConvNets linearize the manifold of natural images. Rich structures also appear in unsupervised
representation learning of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This can enable controlled generation
by simple vector arithmetic (Radford et al., 2016) or non-linear traversal (Wang et al., 2021) operations
on latent vectors to manipulate semantic concepts. Concept classifiers for attributes can be used to disen-
tangle the representations of attributes, thus allowing us to constrain the optimization in a GAN to find
directions that maximally affect the concept attribute (Wang et al., 2021). Shen et al. (2020) and Wu et al.
(2021) showed that the latent space of StyleGAN2 can be disentangled so that each dimension captures at
most one attribute. Others methods train GANs with contrastive learning to learn disentangled represen-
tations (Shoshan et al., 2021). Recently, such concept disentanglement in the activation space has been
attempted in LLMs by training Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAEs) (Huben et al., 2024).
Modulated Features. Controlled image generation and editing is able to control attributes of a human,
such as age, facial hair, eyewear, headwear, pose, facial expressions, and other global features, such as
illumination and artistic styles (Shoshan et al., 2021; Bhattad et al., 2024). Collins et al. (2020) perform
spatially localized edits based on a concept image. Jahanian et al. (2020) showed that activations can be
steered to control camera movements.
Analogy to LLMs. Some techniques in controlled image generation resemble those in RepE for LLMs.
Contastive learning to promote disentanglement of features (Shoshan et al., 2021) uses contrastive examples
where an attribute is or is not present, which is similar to Input Reading with contrastive examples. Other
methods use a concept classifier (Jahanian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2016) to identify
trajectories in the latent space that steer the concept, which resembles identifying a concept operator through
Output Optimization. Similar to RepE methods using Unsupervised Feature Learning (see Section 4.3),
Voynov & Babenko (2020) discover directions corresponding to changes in a concept by having humans
interpret the effect of the changes. Dong et al. (2024a) take inspiration from RepE for LLM safety to derive
steering vectors that can be projected out to increase the safety of generated images.
9.8.2
Games
RepE has been used to interpret the internal world models learned by Transformer models that were trained
in an autoregressive fashion on board games. Nanda et al. (2023) find that Othello-GPT represents the
color of tiles linearly, and steering that vector affects which moves the model believes to be legal or not.
Karvonen (2024) conduct similar experiments for a Chess-GPT model, where they find that individual
pieces and the skill level of players are linearly represented and can be steered. These works indicate that
autoregressive Transformers can learn to implicitly represent world models. Mini et al. (2023) identify a
vector that successfully steers the goal pursued by a policy trained to solve mazes. This is promising since
it could allow us to directly identify and alter the goals pursued by capable AI Agents.
Takeaway: Applications
RepE has been used in
• AI Safety to reduce harmfulness, increase truthfulness, and control refusal behavior.
• Interpretability to confirm the presence and shape of concept representations.
• AI Ethics to reduce societal bias, align LLM behavior with human preferences, and control ethical
reasoning.
• Knowledge Editing to change or unlearn knowledge and adapt model encoded beliefs.
• Other areas such as controlling task execution and text generation and improving general model per-
formance.

Comparing RepE to Other Methods
10.1
Feature Identification and Steering
There is a range of methods that aim to identify activations in the model related to a target concept, which
can then be used to steer the LLM’s internal processes or output behavior.
Activation Patching (AP). In AP, the activations for some neurons on a specific input are replaced with
different activations derived from other inputs. By observing the counterfactual outputs, researchers can
study the causal relationship between internal representations and outputs. In contrast, RepE modifies the
existing activations instead of fully replacing them. RepE also focuses less on a causal understanding of
individual neurons and more on usefully steering behavior.
Model Editing (ME). ME aims to make targeted modifications to the model weights that alter specific
knowledge or behavior while preserving overall performance (Meng et al., 2022; 2023; Fang et al., 2024).
After identifying relevant parameters, one can make precise changes and verify their impact on the model’s
outputs. In contrast to RepE, ME does not directly attempt to identify representations in the activations
space and instead only finds tweaks to the model parameters that bring the desired change.
Probing. In Probing, a classifier is trained to predict the occurrence of a concept in the model’s activations.
The derived classifier can also be used to adapt the activations during inference. Section 6.1.2 explains
that a probe can be used to dynamically decide the strength of the steering function. Furthermore, high
scores of a probe on safety-relevant concepts, like task drift (Abdelnabi et al., 2024a) or deceptive reasoning
(MacDiarmid et al., 2024; Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2025), can trigger a shutdown of the model or engage a
more expensive safety procedure. While probing can be part of Representation Identification, it is usually
not designed to exert control on model behavior.
Causal Abstraction (CA). In CA, a causal model for a task is specified, and an attempt is made to align
the internal activations of a model with this high-level model (Geiger et al., 2024a;b). If intervening on the
causal model has similar effects as intervening on the network representations, it can be said to be a good
abstraction. In principle, this can allow us to identify and manipulate model representations. The focus
of this method lies on its applications to interpretability, while RepE is also applied to control the LLM’s
behavior.
Concept Erasure (CE). CE attempts to identify and remove a concept feature from a model’s represen-
tations. This requires identifying where the feature is represented and then removing it from the activations
or weights. Indeed, some RepE methods attempt to erase concepts from the model representations (Li et al.,
2024b; Rozanova et al., 2023).
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). MI is not a specific method, but a field of study that aims to reverse
engineer the mechanisms learned by Neural Network into human-understandable algorithms. Although RepE
partially grew out of MI, Zou et al. (2023a) present it as a counterproposal. MI takes a bottom-up view by
studying individual neurons and their connections into circuits. While such approaches can explain simple
mechanisms well, they struggle to scale to higher-level concepts and processes. In contrast, RepE takes a
top-down view by interpreting how high-level concepts are implemented as patterns in the representational
space spanned by a large population of neurons. However, in practice, there is no clear delineation between
these approaches.
10.2
Meta-study comparing to Other Methods For Behavior Control
Other methods for controlling the behavior of LLMs include prompting, fine-tuning, and decoding-based
methods. We describe them, contrast them to RepE, and conduct a meta-survey that compares them to
RepE according to their effectiveness and impacts on the model’s capabilities.
For every paper, our meta-survey compares whether the proposed RepE approach or the compared approach
works better for each paper. If available, we also compare which approach retains higher general capabilities
and how many samples were used. When an experiment in a paper was run for multiple tasks, we averaged the
results over the tasks. When there are multiple compared methods from the same category of approach, we

compare to the best-performing one. Lastly, we want to caution the reader that most available comparisons
come from RepE papers, thus, biasing the results in favor of RepE.
10.2.1
Prompting
Changing the (system-)prompt given to an LLM is the most straightforward and commonly used way to
steer the behavior of a model. However, it does so without any changes to weights or activations and does
not provide any interpretability benefits. Furthermore, RepE does not take up space in the context window,
while the additional tokens from prompting, especially when using many in-context examples, increases the
computational cost. Similar to RepE, soft-prompting modifies the model in a continuous embedding space.
It does so by operating on the input embeddings, whereas RepE modifies internal activations or weights.
However, soft-prompting does not have the goal of identifying the representation of a concept.
Empirical Comparison. There are 24 papers (listed in Appendix D) that provide experiments comparing
the effectiveness between RepE and a prompting method. Across the surveyed papers, RepE is more effective
than prompting at steering the target concept in 75% of the cases (see Table 11). Furthermore, it often
had less impact on the general capabilities of the model. Notably, AxBench (Wu et al., 2025) conducts a
thorough comparison between multiple RepE methods and prompting and finds prompting to perform better
at detecting and steering concrete content-related concepts.
10.2.2
Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning modifies the weights of a pre-trained model by further training it on a specific dataset or
reward signal. While fine-tuning does influence the model’s representations, it does not do so in a manner
that is targeted to identifying and controlling representations of specific concepts. Instead, it applies some
uninterpretable, non-sparse changes to the weights that lead to the desired outputs. Unlike RepE, fine-
tuning does not allow for precise and isolated control of concepts of interest. Furthermore, many RepE
methods provide continuous control, where a concept can be increased or decreased to the desired intensity.
As mentioned in Section 6.2.1, there is an overlap between fine-tuning and RepE methods that do output
optimization and apply a weight steering function.
Empirical Comparison. There are 25 papers (listed in Appendix D) that provide experiments comparing
the effectiveness between RepE and a fine-tuning method. Hereby RepE methods such as ReFT (Wu et al.,
2024c) and BIPO Cao et al. (2024a) that are adjacent to fine-tuning are counted towards RepE. Table
11 shows that RepE steers the target concept more effectively in 72% of comparisons, while fine-tuning is
only better in 20% of cases. A majority of comparisons find that fine-tuning deteriorates general model
capabilities more heavily in most cases. Figure 3 lightly indicates that RepE might be more sample effective,
outperforming fine-tuning in every comparison under 500 samples.
10.2.3
Decoding-based Methods
Decoding-based approaches steer the behavior of LLMs by shifting the token probabilities during the decoding
step. Contrastive Decoding takes two sets of token probabilities, contrasts them against each other, and

consequently shifts the token probabilities (Li et al., 2023b). Often, this means taking predictions from two
different models, one of which is better at the desired behavior. Alternatively, contrastive predictions can
be taken from the same model on contrastive inputs.
Similar to RepE methods, this method steers the behavior of the model during inference time. However,
contrastive decoding requires multiple forward passes per generated token. Furthermore, it only superficially
shifts token probabilities and does not tap into the internal representations of LLMs.
Empirical Comparison. There are 7 papers (listed in Appendix D) that provide experiments comparing
the effectiveness between RepE and a decoding-based method. RepE-based methods outperform decoding-
based methods in 71% of cases and have much less impact on general model capabilities.
10.2.4
Combining Methods
One great advantage of RepE is that it works well in combination with other approaches. All four papers
(listed in Appendix D) that evaluate this find that combining RepE with a prompting, fine-tuning, or
decoding-based method delivers more effective control than any of them alone (Banerjee et al., 2024; Stickland
et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024c). This is typically tested in papers where RepE does not
outperform the respective baseline method.
Takeaway: Comparing RepE to Other Methods
Other methods for identifying and editing concept representations, like Activation Patching or Concept
Erasure, are less applicable for controlling output behaviors or have some overlap with RepE. Our meta-
survey shows that RepE offers more effective control at a lower decrease of capabilities compared to
prompting, fine-tuning, and decoding-based approaches.
11
Why Does It Work?
It is somewhat surprising that relatively simple operations on the representations of a model allow us to con-
trol high-level behavior while not destroying capabilities. While there are specific reasons for the effectiveness
of different methods, this section offers some general explanations for this phenomenon.
LLMs already represent human-understandable concepts. LLMs seem to represent some human-
understandable concepts like refusal or honesty. This makes it possible to tap into those representations
and change their behavior. Thus, RepE does not need to learn the concept representations anew but simply
identifies and promotes them.
35

## Page 36

Models have structured representations. LLMs represent concepts in a structured way. RepE can
uncover and exploit this structure. For example, concepts might be represented as linear directions in the
activation space of LLMs. This Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) (Park et al., 2024b) implies that
scaling the direction corresponding to a concept increases the intensity of that concept. Many RepE methods
are explicitly inspired by LRH or implicitly built on it. If the LRH is true, it explains the success of many
RepE methods.
The plausibility of the LRH has been an area of much discussion in the interpretability community. In
fact, some features have been proven to be represented linearly in autoregressive models trained for board
games (Nanda et al., 2023; Karvonen, 2024) and in LLMs. Many concepts in LLMs have been decoded
through linear probes (Li et al., 2024e; Abdou et al., 2021; Grand et al., 2018), and the success of many
Representation Engineering methods is itself evidence for linear representations of high-level concepts. On
the other hand, Engels et al. (2025) find non-linear features, such as circular representations for the days of
the week.
Resilience to activation manipulation.
Neural Networks are able to remain functional after their
activations are manipulated. For example, adding small random perturbations to the activations does not
strongly affect model performance (Reagen et al., 2018). This resilience might be attributable to dropout
during training. Furthermore, the concept operator is derived from previous activations of the same network,
which could mean that the manipulated activations still remain in the usual distribution of activations. This
makes it possible to retain general capabilities.
Control over intermediate variables. Neural Networks can be seen as programs where activations are
intermediate memory containing variables and are functions that perform operations on these variables.
Changing variables in that memory changes the further computation and, ultimately, the output. When
RepE operates on representations of concepts in the activations, this is similar to editing semantically
meaningful variables in the intermediate memory of a Neural Network.
Takeaway: Why it works
Models represent human-understandable concepts in structured, possibly linear ways. By manipulating
these latent variables, we can influence the model’s later computations. LLMs remain functional since
they are somewhat resilient to internal manipulations.

Challenges in Representation Engineering
12.1
Empirical Weaknesses
Multi-Concept Control. Applying RepE for multiple concepts at once reduces the effectiveness of steering
(van der Weij et al., 2024; Scalena et al., 2024) and leads to larger reductions in model capabilities (Scalena
et al., 2024). This might be because applying multiple edits can lead to interference between concept rep-
resentations (van der Weij et al., 2024). An exception is that combining specific vectors derived by BiPO
Cao et al. (2024a) seems to increase their effectiveness. Improving multi-concept control is recognised as
one of the major challenges in RepE (Cao et al., 2024a; Postmus & Abreu, 2024; van der Weij et al., 2024;
Dong et al., 2024b; Chu et al., 2024). While there are proposals to steer different concepts in different layers
(van der Weij et al., 2024), this limits the number of concepts that can be steered simultaneously. Fur-
thermore, Scalena et al. (2024) dynamically adjust the strength of interventions which reduces the negative
effects of multi-concept control. Further, there are attempts to control broader representations, like “human
preferences”, that encapsulate multiple desired concepts Liu et al. (2023). Nguyen et al. (2025) improve
multi-concept steering by sparsely applying each steering vector only at some tokens and enforcing orthog-
onality between steering vectors to reduce interference. Lastly, Beaglehole et al. (2025) report progress on
multi-concept steering based on non-linear feature learning.
Long-Form Generation. While RepE can effectively control short answers, there is a lack of evidence for its
ability to control long-form generations and multi-turn conversations. Indeed, there is preliminary evidence
that operators identified from a training set with short answers do not effectively steer long generations
36

## Page 37

(Pres et al., 2024). This calls for a thorough evaluation of new RepE methods for longer generations. Recent
work has started to address this problem by retaining the natural distribution of activations (Cao et al.,
2024a) and dynamically adjusting the representation control throughout a generation (Scalena et al., 2024).
Out-of-Distribution Generalization. To effectively steer a concept, our concept operator should general-
ize from its training data to different contexts, prompt templates, or different generation tasks. Additionally,
if a concept operator does not generalize across different situations, we cannot argue that we have found a
general representation of the concept. However, this still presents a challenge for current RepE pipelines,
which become less effective when the system prompt differs between the training and test set (Tan et al.,
2024) and when the operator is identified after the answer but employed before the answer (Simhi et al.,
2024). Evaluating and improving the ability of RepE methods for OOD generalization will be crucial (Mack
& Turner, 2024a; Zou et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023a; Ackerman, 2024).
Deterioration of Capabilities. RepE generally leads to a reduction in general language modeling capabil-
ities and the quality and diversity of generated text (Scalena et al., 2024; Stickland et al., 2024; Zhang et al.,
2024c). Aside from the quality of the generated text, Park et al. (2024a) points out that steered models can
be worse at instruction following. While this reduction is rather small, it still represents an important cost
to employing RepE that should be reduced. Increasing the strength of the intervention reduces the capabil-
ities (Wu et al., 2025; Durmus et al., 2024). This effect could appear because RepE disrupts the underlying
structure of a model’s activations (Zhang et al., 2024c). Thus, finding improvements to reduce or better
navigate the trade-off between control effectiveness and general model capabilities will be crucial (Li et al.,
2024b; Wu et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024c). Efforts to solve this problem include fine-tuning the model to
prevent reductions in quality through RepE (Stickland et al., 2024), moderating the intervention strength
to only steer when necessary (Li et al., 2024d), and more precisely localising the concept representations
(Wang et al., 2024b). Others attempt to mitigate this by retaining the underlying structure of the LLM
(Zhang et al., 2024c), keeping the magnitude of activations consistent (Pham & Nguyen, 2024), or providing
an output-based goal to retain text quality (Xu et al., 2024b).
Learning Specific Concept Representations. Ideally, RepE would steer a concept without influencing
other, unrelated concepts. However, in practice, RepE methods struggle to isolate a concept representation
from other concepts. For example, steering towards happiness reduces refusal rates for harmful requests
(Zou et al., 2023a), steering away from harmfulness makes the model less helpful (Wolf et al., 2024), and
steering gender awareness can increase age-based biases (Durmus et al., 2024).
Learning Complete Concept Representations. We would like RepE to identify a concept operator
which represents the concepts with all its aspects and in different contexts.
A concept like Honesty is
multi-faceted and is applied differently depending on the context. However, identifying such complex repre-
sentations is challenging and likely requires a large coverage of aspects and contexts in the training data, as
well as a concept operator that is expressive enough. Chen et al. (2024b) address this by learning multiple
orthogonal steering vectors that are supposed to capture different aspects of a concept.
Unreliability. RepE methods are generally unreliable and tend to fail in three ways. Firstly, they are
sensitive to the hyperparameters chosen. Often, a small seemingly insignificant change in hyperparameters
can cause significant performance decreases (Zhang et al., 2024c; Adila et al., 2024b). This indicates that
the chosen RepE setup is not robust. Secondly, there are often concepts that cannot be successfully steered.
While it is common for papers to mainly report on the successful applications of their method, more neutral
investigations often find concepts that can not be successfully steered (Tan et al., 2024; Tanneru et al., 2024).
Braun et al. (2025) provide evidence that some concepts are not effectively steered because the difference
between positive and negative activations is not consistent and not linearly separable.
Lastly, even for
interventions that are successful in steering the average behavior, there are inputs for which the steering
effect is negative (Tan et al., 2024; Stickland et al., 2024). This can especially be the case for examples that
were already positive with respect to the concept (Im & Li, 2025). This unreliability hinders the deployment
of RepE methods.
Unreliable Interpretability. RepE is often used as a tool to interpret LLM representations, but it is
questionable whether they provide strong evidence or are largely misleading. Firstly, a failure to identify
an effective linear operator for a concept does not prove that the concept is not linearly represented in the
37

## Page 38

model. It could merely be a failure of the method to find the relevant directions. Secondly, it has been shown
that finding an effective intervention in specific layers or attention heads does not prove that the concept is
actually localized there (Tan et al., 2024). Thirdly, there can be multiple different vectors that successfully
steer the concept. Consequently, a direction that steers the model is not necessarily the single direction that
represents the concept (Subramani et al., 2022).
Requires Access to Models’ Internals. RepE methods rely on access to models’ internals and activations.
This limits who is able to create and employ RepE methods. Xu et al. (2024b) partially circumvent this
by using RepE on white-box models to find safety vectors, use them to derive attack prompts, and transfer
those attack prompts to a black-box model.
Computational Cost. Although RepE is highly efficient during inference and cheap to train, multiple
papers aim to improve the computational efficiency of deriving or employing RepE methods. This can be
done by removing the need to perform expensive hyperparameter tuning (Xu et al., 2024b) or expensive
iterative optimization (Qiu et al., 2024; Jorgensen et al., 2024). The additional operations necessary to
manipulate activations during inference can be avoided by instead manipulating weights (Wang et al., 2024a).
12.2
Principled Challenges
In addition to these previous general challenges and weaknesses, we further break down the challenges
according to each step in the pipeline.
12.2.1
Challenges in Representation Identification
Spuriously Correlated Concepts.
Current RI methods are mostly not able to disentangle concepts
that are correlated. As a result, the identified concept operator will also capture and steer the spuriously
correlated concept (Tan et al., 2024). Concepts can be correlated because they often occur together in the
inputs, because the output scoring evaluates both highly or because their representations tend to be activated
at the same time. This presents a major hurdle for precisely identifying a concept representation. Sparse
Autoencoders might be able to address this by identifying disentangling concept representations.
Concept Misspecification. Representation Identification forces us to specify the target concept by pro-
viding a scoring function or inputs related to the concept. Through these, we are hoping to elicit the model’s
representation of this concept. However, if the concept specification differs from the intended concepts, the
identified concept operator will not be accurate. Deng et al. (2025) point out that RI methods based on
contrastive pre-prompts implicitly assume that the model actually follows the pre-prompt.
Furthermore, even when the specified inputs or scoring functions are accurate, they might activate other
representations than the ones for the desired concept. For example, we might instruct a model to be honest
or dishonest and hope this activates the model representations of “I will be honest/dishonest”. However, for
a model that was trying to deceive, such an input might instead activate a representation for “The human
wants me to be honest/dishonest”, which is importantly different from the intended concept.
Additionally, models might use concepts that are not understandable for humans.
They might use an
ontology that differs from ours or discover new concepts. In this case, it would be difficult to specify and
steer these concepts.
Interference from Superposition. Interpretability research has shown that LLMs are polysemantic since
they represent more features than they have neurons (Elhage et al., 2022). Thus, networks represent features
in superposition, meaning that features are not all orthogonal to each other, which results in interference
between features. In practice, this will mean that controlling a concept representation will also steer some
other concepts. Thus, concept operators are not specific to a concept and have side effects on unrelated
concepts. Nguyen et al. (2025) attempt to reduce interference by enforcing orthogonality between concept
vectors, thus improving multi-concept steering.
Assumptions on Available Data. RepE methods often only work when specific data is available. Firstly,
it is not always possible to provide contrastive inputs that describe the behavior and its opposite (Jorgensen
et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2024; Postmus & Abreu, 2024). Secondly, many methods rely on expensive human-
38

## Page 39

annotated ground-truth data (Adila et al., 2024b;a). Lastly, methods are not designed to handle noisy and
biased data Adila et al. (2024a).
Reliance on Models’ Own Representations. RepE methods tap into the existing representations of a
model. Consequently, a concept cannot be controlled with RepE if the network did not learn a representation
for it.
Interpretability Lacks Ground Truth. The challenge of developing methods that find representations
related to a concept is very difficult because there is no ground truth for where and how the model represents
a concept. Thus, we cannot know whether we have identified an accurate representation or what the semantic
significance of the concept operator is (Herrmann & Levinstein, 2024).
12.2.2
Challenges in Representation Operationalization
Assumptions About Models’ Representations. Methods for identifying concept operators come with
assumptions about the shape and geometry of representations in the models’ activations. Common assump-
tions about representations are that concepts are represented as linear direction (Qiu et al., 2024), that
representations do not change throughout a sequence of inputs, that they are the same across context, that
they are localized in a single layer, and that they do not rely on interactions between layers. However, if
the true form of the representation does not match these assumptions, it will lead to unsuccessful or less
effective Representation Identification and Control.
These assumptions have been criticized (Luo et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024). Assumptions have been changed
and weakened by shifting from a point-in-space to a direction-magnitude view (Pham & Nguyen, 2024),
adapting the strength and direction of steering to the context (Wang et al., 2024c), or applying non-linear
operations (Qiu et al., 2024; Hoscilowicz et al., 2024).
An additional challenge is that a feature might not have a single representation. For example, (Goldman-
Wetzler & Turner, 2024) find 800 orthogonal vectors that steer “write code” and (Mack & Turner, 2024b)
finds 200 independent vectors with which a model represents that a request is harmless. While this might
be due to weaknesses in the specific methods or because of wrong assumptions about the representations
geometry, it could also mean that some concepts are represented in multiple ways inside a model. This
challenges traditional notions in RepE, where it is assumed that there is one representation of the concept.
12.2.3
Challenges in Representation Control
Shifting Activations off Their Natural Distribution. Manipulating the weights and activations of a
model can shift the representations off of their natural distribution. In turn, this can lead to a deterioration
of LLMs’ capabilities since later computations in the model might be disturbed by the unnatural shift in
activations. While steering was found to only cause small shifts in the distribution (van der Weij et al.,
2024), this effect could be detrimental when the strength of intervention is increased or many concepts are
steered at the same time.
Takeaway: Challenges in Representation Engineering
RepE struggles with steering multiple concepts at once, controlling long-form generations, and providing
a reliable steering effect. These weaknesses arise because of challenges like the inability to disentangle
spuriously correlated concepts, to posit correct assumptions about models’ representations, and to retain
the models’ natural distribution of activations.
13
Opportunities for Future Research
13.1
Opportunities to Improve Representation Identification
Refining Identified Operators. The identified concept operator could be improved to make it better
suited for control. For example, an operator identified through Input Reading could be refined by fine-
tuning it to produce desired outputs or by decomposing it with an SAE and removing unrelated features. In
39

## Page 40

general, there is promise in developing pipelines that combine different RI methods. For example, Wu et al.
(2025) suggest that finding concept operators by jointly learning for concept detection and steering can be
more effective.
Data-centric RepE. Most efforts for improving RI focus on new calculations for deriving the concept
operator. However, recent work indicates that the quality of a concept operator is strongly dependent on the
quality of the dataset it is trained on (Tan et al., 2024; Braun et al., 2025) and improves when it is trained
on more data (see Appendix A.2). Akin to data-centric approaches to train better models (Zha et al., 2025),
a focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of data could be key to improving RI. Furthermore, detailed
investigations of the properties of datasets that lead to strong steering performance could unlock important
insights.
Better Methods for Scoring Outputs. Currently, most Output Optimization methods simply compare
outputs to a ground-truth text. There are more accurate and flexible ways for scoring the alignment of
outputs with a concept. One could use a human judge, LLM-as-a-judge, a trained reward model, or specific
context-dependent metrics. Furthermore, one could use the performance in an environment, like rewarding
actions in a multi-agent negotiation setup based on the final agreement (Abdelnabi et al., 2024b).
Combine with Other Interpretability Methods. As described in Section 10.1, there exist other methods
that aim to identify representations of concepts in LLMs. While these might not produce suitable concept
operators themselves, they could provide information about the representation that can be leveraged for
Representation Identification. At least, it would be interesting to compare the identified representations
from different methods for the same concept.
Finding and Analyzing Failure Modes. We hypothesize that spuriously correlations between concepts
and concept misspecification pose challenges for effective Representation Identification. However, there is
no empirical evidence for this yet. Exploring such theoretically plausible failure modes could uncover new
weaknesses to be addressed by improved RI methods.
Automated Interpretability. LLMs can judge which concepts a feature corresponds to by looking at
highly activating inputs and outputs. This is commonly done in Unsupervised Feature Learning to identify
concept operators. A similar approach could be used to refine concept operators identified by other RI
methods. An LLM can automatically judge the inputs and outputs activating for multiple concept operators.
13.2
Opportunities to Improve Representation Operationalization
Expanding on Linear Representations. Most RepE pipelines assume that concepts are represented as
linear directions. However, in practice, representations might be non-linear. As noted previously, there is
early work on RepE for non-linear steering, but more exploration of non-linear representations is necessary.
Context-Dependent Control. Current RepE methods assume that the representation of a concept is
the same for every context and thus apply the same intervention independent of the inputs. However, the
model might represent a concept differently in different contexts. There is already work that dynamically
adjusts the strength or composition of concept operators. However, future work could learn separate concept
operators for a range of situations or train a small model that can predict the right concept operator to apply
in a new situation.
Modeling Trajectories of Representations. Current RepE methods assume that representations of a
concept remain static throughout a generation. However, it could also be that the representation of a concept
changes over time. In that case, representations of interests are better modeled as trajectories of activations
over inference steps.
Inter-Layer Dependencies. Recent work (Lindsey et al., 2024) shows that representations of some con-
cepts can be spread over multiple layers. Current RepE methods are not capable of capturing these inter-
layer dependencies. To address this, RI methods could concurrently optimize multiple concept operators at
different layers.
Modeling Interactions Between Concept Representations. Current RepE methods aim to find an
isolated representation of a single concept.
But this misses any interactions and relationships between
40

## Page 41

multiple concepts. For example, there could be a specific representation oA∧B if concepts A and B are both
present, or there could be conditional representations oB|A of B given that A is present. Thus, attempting to
identify interacting representations between concepts could uncover more rich concepts the model is using.
More Complex Operators.
Current operators are mostly relatively simple.
Perhaps more complex
operators could capture more comprehensive and nuanced representations. It might be possible to train a
Neural Network to predict a concept operator for the given inputs. Furthermore, an ensemble of concept
operators could be trained on different portions of the data or different clusters of activations to capture
different aspects of a concept.
Feature Geometry as a Hyperparameter. Current work starts by assuming the geometry of the concept
representation and then aims to identify the concept representation adhering to that geometry. By trying
out multiple geometries for one concept and then measuring their effectiveness, we can expect to find the
geometry that most suits the specific concept representation. Additionally, RepE would benefit from further
understanding the geometry of concepts in Transformer Language Models, which is already an active field
of study (Jiang et al., 2024a; Csordás et al., 2024).
13.3
Opportunities to Improve Representation Control
Combining Weight and Activation Steering Functions. Representations are an interplay between
weights and activations. Thus, it could be beneficial to develop methods that control weights and activations
together. Naively, one could apply RepE for a concept to the weights and also apply it to the activations.
Furthermore, it could be interesting to strengthen or weaken certain representations while training the model,
thus guiding which representations are learned by the model.
Complex Steering Sequences. By applying steering for different sequences at different time points in a
generation, RepE can be used to steer more complex behaviors or ensure that LLMs abide by a predefined
pattern. For example, the providers of an LLM might want it to answer code-related questions by first
steering for “detailed reasoning” while the problem is being analyzed, then for “not containing errors” while
new code suggestions are generated, and lastly for “friendliness” while the model asks for clarifications.
More expressive steering functions. Krasheninnikov & Krueger (2024) find in a toy setting that more
expressive steering functions, whose operators have more parameters, can reach a higher performance ceiling
and control more complex tasks while requiring more data. This indicates there is promise in developing
more expressive steering functions to push the Pareto frontier of steering effectiveness and data-efficiency.
Controlling Learning Processes with RepE. Yu et al. (2024) repeatedly ablate the refusal feature to
learn more robust refusal mechanisms. This highlights that steering during training can be used to influence
the representations that are being learned by the model. Aside from ablating features, representations can be
positively steered potentially to make them more salient in the learning process. On the other hand, learning
representations in specific ways can provide concept operators to steer model behavior. For example, Cloud
et al. (2024) use Gradient Routing to control where in the network specific capabilities are localized, thus
enabling to unlearn specific capabilities during inference.
13.4
Possible Applications of Representation Engineering
After outlining current applications in Section 9, we now suggest some further problems that could be
addressed with RepE.
Agent Goals. RepE could be used to control the goals pursued by an LLM Agent. Previous work achieved
this for RL agents (Mini et al., 2023), but the growing popularity of LLM agents trained with Reinforcement
Learning (OpenAI, 2024) makes it timely to apply RepE to steer their goals. Controlling an agent away from
dangerous and towards desirable goals could be a simple but effective technique for mitigating misalignment
in LLM Agents. RepE might be uniquely capable of adjusting agent goals compared to prompting. An AI
system that intrinsically values a goal is instrumentally incentivized to retain that goal (Bostrom, 2012),
even when it is prompted to change its goal. However, RepE might be able to directly edit the goal the AI
is pursuing by steering its own representations.
41

## Page 42

Studying In-Context Learning. Finding out how and why in-context learning (ICL) works is a hotly
debated topic. By controlling representations, it might be possible to steer the hypothesis class ICL uses
and thus make progress on understanding the patterns and algorithm enabling ICL.
Preventing Deception. AI systems behaving as if they are aligned with human interests while secretly
pursuing different goals is a key worry in the AI Safety community. RepE could provide unique control over
models’ behavior when the AI is attempting to deceive the user (Park et al., 2024c). In this case, it will not
suffice to instruct the model to be truthful. However, by directly accessing the model’s own representations
and thus influencing its “thought process”, RepE might be able to control it to be more honest.
Controlling Coooperation. As LLM agents become more ubiquitous, they will often interact and negotiate
with other LLM agents. Through RepE, it might be possible to control how agents behave and cooperate in
multi-agent scenarios.
Value Engineering. RepE could be used to identify specific ethical values to let users personalize their
LLM agent. For example, a user could specify which beings the AI should give moral consideration to, which
moral theory it should apply, or what its stance on specific issues should be.
Red Teaming. RepE could be used when red-teaming and evaluating LLMs. Firstly, for open-weight
models, which can easily be controlled towards harmful outcomes through RepE, it should be standard to
also apply RepE during red-teaming. Secondly, for closed-weight models, applying RepE to jailbreak a model
could serve as a worst-case safety failure that can be evaluated (Che et al., 2024).
Studying the Development of Concept Representations. RepE could be used to identify and steer
representations for the same concept in different stages of training or different models, thus giving insights
about when representations of a concept emerge and how they change. One could use RepE to study how
concepts evolve throughout pre-training and how they are influenced by various post-training methods or
how concepts emerge across models of different sizes in the same family.

Building a More Rigorous Science of Representation Engineering
The field of Representation Engineering is young and does not yet stand on a strong scientific foundation.
To enable progress in the field, we point out the opportunity to make research into RepE more rigorous and
to provide a better grounding for the field.
13.5.1
Best Practices for Evaluating RepE Methods
Better Measurements of Controllability. It is, in general, hard to evaluate whether the outputs of
an LLM were successfully steered towards a concept. Many papers, therefore, employ LLMs to judge how
much an output corresponds to a concept. While this can be a convenient and effective metric (Zheng et al.,
2023), using LLMs-as-a-judge is known to be biased and sometimes inaccurate (Fu et al., 2024; Zheng et al.,
2023). Alternatively, many studies rely on existing benchmarks, which largely only include short answers,
thus ignoring the evaluation of more free- and long-form generation.
Reporting Changes in Models’ Quality. Only a minority ( 35%) of papers report the change in models’
capabilities after applying Representation Engineering. Since we know that RepE can reduce these capabil-
ities, it is important to have a standard of reporting measures of LLMs’ quality so that we can compare the
merits of each method. These could include performance on popular performance benchmarks or changes in
perplexity Braun et al. (2024).
Measuring Out-of-Distribution Generalisation. As noted earlier, measuring how effectively an oper-
ator is able to control an LLM in cases that are different from those where the operator was identified is
an open challenge. However, most papers only measure performance on distributions that are similar to the
training data, which leads to overly optimistic results.
Comparing to SOTA Methods. When proposing a new method, its effectiveness should be compared to
the current state-of-the-art method. However, often papers only compare to early methods that have since
been surpassed.
42

## Page 43

Survivorship Bias. It is rare for papers that propose new methods for Representation Engineering to
demonstrate concepts or situations in which control is not effective. However, papers that set out to neutrally
evaluate the method often find weaknesses or limitations not obvious from the original paper. This practice
can give false perceptions and stifle progress in the field. Thus, we encourage authors to report on null
results.
Reporting Variance. Tan et al. (2024) rightly point out that many papers only report on average steer-
ability. However, it is essential to showcase the distribution of results so readers see whether a method
provides reliable steerability.
Testing on Different Model Sizes. Appendix A.1 finds that most RepE experiments are conducted on
models between 3-10 billion parameters. To prove the general effectiveness of a RepE method, it is necessary
to evaluate it on models of different sizes. Specifically, larger models need to be tested to prove that the
method scales to frontier models.
13.5.2
Benchmarking RepE Pipelines
There is currently no benchmark that provides a way to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of a RepE
pipeline. Thus we are currently unsure which pipeline is most effective in which situations. A benchmark can
also serve as a guide for the future development of RepE methods by providing clarity about the effectiveness
of methods and being a target to aim for. Such unified evaluations can also surface previously undiscovered
limitations of methods (Brumley et al., 2024).
Such a benchmark should cover a range of concepts of different types since different RepE methods might
steer different concepts more effectively (Brumley et al., 2024). Hereby, the focus should lie on use cases
where RepE is foreseen to be practically useful, such as improving truthfulness, changing goals, adapting
situational awareness, or removing societal biases. Furthermore, evaluations should cover multiple models,
test the influence of dataset size, and show the impact of different steering strengths. Additionally, it should
specifically evaluate the weaknesses of current RepE methods (see Section 12.1), thus putting a spotlight
on improvements on these challenges. Of course, this benchmark should make sure to follow best practices
outlined above (Section 13.5.1.
Such a benchmark could also provide a testing ground for rigorous comparison. One challenge in developing a
RepE benchmark lies in providing fair comparisons between RepE methods that have different requirements,
assumptions, and goals. They might have different requirements on the available data, require different
amounts of compute, or were developed to control different kinds of concepts.
AxBench (Wu et al., 2025) is a benchmark that evaluates 9 different RepE methods on 500 concepts. However,
all concepts are of a similar type, testing whether a concrete, narrow topic is contained in a text. Extensions
to this benchmark should consider different types of concepts. Im & Li (2025) conduct an evaluation of
different Input Reading methods for Representation Identification. However, they only focus on high-level
behaviors and always use a vector as a concept operator and Linear Addition as a steering function. An
extension could consider different concepts and methods for Representation Control.
13.5.3
Groundwork for RepE
Developing Theoretical Frameworks.
The field of RepE is almost entirely based on experimental
evidence and lacks a clear theoretical framework. Fields such as Adversarial ML and Machine Unlearning
have greatly benefited from a shared theoretical framework that formulates the settings and objectives (Cao
& Yang, 2015). Such a theoretical framework could clearly state the problem RepE attempts to solve and
provide criteria for success. For example, current theoretical work on RepE has found that difference-in-
means is optimal at identifying a vector that shifts negative to positive examples (Im & Li, 2025; Singh
et al., 2024).
Causality and RepE. RepE aims to identify representations that are causally related to a concept of interest
and apply interventions that cause predictable changes in output behavior. Taking a causal perspective on
RepE, the treatment could be the relation of a string to the concept or the intervention applied to the
representations, and the effect could be the change in activations or in output behavior. Frameworks from
43

## Page 44

causality, such as Structural Causal Models (SCMs) based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (Pearl, 2014)
and the Potential Outcomes (PO) framework (Rubin, 1974) could provide a theoretical grounding for RepE.
A causal graph describing the computations of the model allows for the application of the do-calculus. This
would enable us (1) to find minimal interventions that have the desired steering effect via the back door
criterion, (2) to estimate the causal effect of representations despite the presence of unobserved confounders
via the front door rule and (3) to distinguish interventions that have a direct or indirect effect on the desired
outputs. However, this comes with multiple assumptions and requires one to identify how patterns in the
activations of a network relate to nodes in the causal graph. Indeed, such an attempt has been made by
formalizing (Geiger et al., 2024a) and conducting (Geiger et al., 2024b) the search for a DAG of high-level
concepts that aligns with the neuron-level activity in the network.
Alternatively, using the PO framework does not require DAG and instead leverages covariates. This allows
the use of tools such as propensity score matching or doubly robust estimation to assess the causal effect
of modifications to representation and thus enables causal adjustments of the interventions. However, this
assumes that confounding factors can be adequately controlled using observed covariates.
Lastly, causality can inform the design of input datasets from which concept operators are derived Deng
et al. (2025).
This can help to better isolate the causal mechanism from confounders and improve ood
generalization.
Studying RepE on Toy Setting. Krasheninnikov & Krueger (2024) develop a simple classification task
as a toy setting to run controlled experiments evaluating RepE methods for tasks of different complexities.
Such toy settings can help us to gain a deeper understanding how and why RepE works. They can also serve
as testbeds to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different RepE methods. Such toy setups could be
used to study the impact of model size, data quality and assumed feature geometries.
Building a Library of Concept Representations. An ambitious effort could aim to map out a library
of concepts and their representation in a specific model. This could serve as a valuable resource for later
study. For example, by using this database, it might be possible to train models that can predict the concept
operator for new concepts. Furthermore, such a database could serve as a baseline for the development of
new RepE methods.
Finding Best Practices.
Practitioners using RepE want to easily know which methodology is most
effective. However, currently, it is not clear which method should be used practically. Finding best practices
for using RepE and then describing them in an easily accessible form could greatly increase the adoption of
this technique.
Developing Tooling for RepE. Great software tools for fine-tuning, such as the Transformers library (Wolf
et al., 2020), make it easy to use this technique, thus boosting its adoption. Developing dedicated tooling,
such as APIs or libraries, for RepE could be similarly valuable. An example of such work is Gemma Scope
(Neuronpedia, 2025) which allows novices to analyze and steer SAE features derived from Gemma-2-2b.
Takeaway: Opportunities for Future Research
Future RepE methods can expand restrictive notions of representations, combine multiple RI methods
and attempt more complex interventions. Untapped applications lie in steering goals and values of agents
or preventing deceptive behavior. To progress the field of RepE, thorough evaluations and best practices
are needed.

Conclusion
Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling and interpreting Large Language
Models by manipulating their internal representations. This survey has provided a comprehensive overview
of RepE methods, focusing on different methods to identify, operationalize, and control the representations
of the model. By synthesizing insights from over 100 recent studies, we have highlighted key advancements,
methodologies, and challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
44

## Page 45

Our analysis reveals that most RepE methods identify representations by providing contrasting inputs and
controlling them by adding a vector to the activations. Furthermore, many approaches are based on the Lin-
ear Representation Hypothesis. These methods have been applied to AI Safety, Ethics, and Interpretability
by controlling concepts such as Harmfulness, Fairness, and Truthfulness.
We find that RepE tends to be more effective at a lower cost to generation quality compared to prompting,
fine-tuning, and decoding-based methods. However, challenges remain in ensuring reliability, robustness,
and quality, especially for tasks requiring long-form generation and multi-concept control. Issues such as
spuriously related concepts, assumptions about feature geometries, and distributional shifts caused by RepE
must be addressed. Further research should prioritize the development of more rigorous ways of evaluating
and comparing RepE methods. Furthermore, researchers should explore representations that are non-linear,
developing over time, spanning layers, and interacting with each other.
We believe RepE will prove to have important advantages compared to other control methods. RepE might
be especially advantageous when there is a need to control not only the output of the model but also the
internal processes by which it arrives at these outputs. As such, it is likely that RepE will become a common
tool for engineers to control and for researchers to study LLMs.

A
Meta-survey
In order to get a better feeling for how research on RepE is conducted, we conducted a meta-survey where
we gathered which models and sample sizes were used. Furthermore, we collect statistics about the papers
including authors and publication dates. This meta-survey only includes papers published before 31.8.2024.
A.1
Commonly Used Models
The most popular models are the base and respective instruction-tuned models of Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-13B,
Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B.
We find that a majority of experiments (164 out of 229) are performed on base models that have not been
trained with RLHF, while 65 experiments are conducted on preference-tuned models. While experimental
results in Dong et al. (2024b); von Rütte et al. (2024) find a larger effect from applying RepE to base models
than to instruction-tuned models, Bortoletto et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2024c) find no clear relationship
between instruction-tuning and steering effectiveness.
Figure 4 shows that a majority of models to which RepE has been applied on lie between 3 −10 billion
parameters. This is underlined by the fact that 9 out of the 10 most popular models for RepE are all between
7 −13 billion parameters. Furthermore, 8 of them belong to the Llama family of models or are derived from
Llama models. This calls for more diversity in which model experiments are performed. However, the model
scale might not be a crucial factor for the effectiveness of RepE. Across 4 papers that compare the steerability
of models across different numbers of parameters within the same model family, none find a clear relationship
between scale and steerability (Arditi et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a; Arora et al., 2024; Bortoletto et al., 2024).
Furthermore, only Templeton et al. (2024) are able to experiment on a proprietary, state-of-the-art model,
thus leaving open questions about how effective RepE is at larger scales and for the most capable models.

Number of experiments
Figure 4: The number of experiments applying RepE to a model with specific numbers of parameters.
Almost all papers focus on transformer language models, while Paulo et al. (2024) find that CAA can also
be applied to RNNs by steering the in-layer activations or the state-space. Furthermore, Adila et al. (2024b)
apply RepE to a vision-language model. This indicates that RepE can be an architecture-agnostic method.

A.2
Number of Samples
We note how many samples were used during Representation Identification to derive the operator. Figure 5
shows that most papers use between 100 and 1000 samples, showcasing that RepE can be relatively sample
efficient. However, as with fine-tuning and ICL, RepE benefits from using more samples. Qiu et al. (2024),
Yin et al. (2024), and Wang et al. (2024c) find that the effectiveness of steering improves as the number of
samples for Representation Identification increases. However, Adila et al. (2024b) find no such relationship
in their unsupervised method. Lastly, Krasheninnikov & Krueger (2024) find that more expressive steering
functions, whose concept operators have more parameters and that contain more operations, work less well
with a low amount of data but can better leverage high amounts of data.
There is no general recommendation on the necessary number of samples, which depends on the model,
target concept and method used. Building more sample-efficient methods and identifying the scaling laws of
RepE are promising avenues of inquiry.

Statistics about Publications on Representation Engineering
Applying vs. Improving. A majority of papers set out to make methodological improvements to RepE
(60 out of 87), while 22 mostly focus on applying RepE to solve a problem. Only 3 papers aim to evaluate
RepE methods.
Academic vs. Industry Papers. Work on RepE is mostly done by academics, with 58 out of 87 papers
only featuring academic co-authors. Another 19 papers are collaborations between academia and industry,
while only 8 papers are solely authored by industry researchers.
Publication Date. We take the date of the initial publication of a paper and plot them in Figure 6. Here,
we count the first time a paper was published. If a paper was first uploaded on arXiv and later published in
a conference, we count the date of the initial arXiv submission.

Takeaway: Meta-survey
• Models: A majority of models used have between 3-10 billion parameters.
According to current
literature, there appears to be no relationship between RepE effectiveness and model scale.
• Samples: More samples make RepE more effective.
• Publication statistics: A majority of papers on RepE come from academics. The literature is very
new but growing rapidly.
B
Survey Methodology
We conducted a structured survey that resulted in a new taxonomy and summary of existing applications but
also serves as a meta-study that compares RepE to other methods and gathers interesting meta-statistics.
B.1
Literature Search
Firstly, we started with 3 seminal papers (Zou et al., 2023a; Turner et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023a) and
conducted a forward search. Secondly, we used the combinations of search terms {“Activation Steering”,
“Representation Engineering”, “Concept Activation Vectors”, “Linear Probe + Steering”} + {“Language
Model”, “LLM”, “Neural Network”}. Thirdly, the citations of relevant papers were checked.
To distinguish papers on RepE from related methods, we adopt five criteria for inclusion and point to papers
that were excluded by this criterion.
• Operates with LLMs. This excludes the sizeable literature on using steering vectors in image
generation models like GANs and Diffusion models, which we describe in Section 9.8.
• Identifies a Concept Representation. A representation related to the target concept needs to
be identified instead of only training the network.
60

## Page 61

• Controls Models’ Behavior. This excludes work that solely focuses on interpreting LLMs without
modifying representations.
• Performs Post-hoc Representation Identification.
We focus on identifying representation
after training instead of retraining the network to produce desired concept representations.
• Steers the Intermediate Representations.
We focus on representation steering instead of
shifting token embeddings or logits.
This exhaustive literature search was conducted in September of 2024 and only covers papers published
until 31.8.2024. We include many RepE papers published after that date but do not guarantee a complete
coverage of later publications.
B.2
Extracting Information from Papers
While surveying papers, we extracted key information upon which the survey was built. A full list of the
information we extract can be found in Appendix C.
Regarding the methodology, we developed the taxonomy after a first non-exhaustive read of the literature.
On a second, exhaustive read, we classified where methods fall in our taxonomy but also recorded many
methodological details that allowed us to map the space of choices when applying RepE. Furthermore, we
identify which target concepts were engineered and what problem the paper attempted to solve, thus letting
us cluster papers into categories of applications. We noted any experimental comparisons with other RepE
methods or other methods for controlling LLMs’ behavior. Additionally, we gathered experimental details
like the model, dataset, and sample size used. Furthermore, we extracted meta-information like the date
and venue of publication and association of the authors. To gather views on RepE, we recorded citations
where authors expressed how they see RepE as useful, how they think it works, what weaknesses they see,
and which future work would be valuable. See Appendix C for all information we extracted from the papers.
We used the assistance of Claude-3.5-Sonnet to extract information from papers. While this sometimes sped
up the process of identifying key information, it is not sufficiently reliable to be trusted to retrieve information
faithfully. Thus, we read every paper ourselves and confirmed the correctness of any LLM-generated answers
before including them in this survey.
