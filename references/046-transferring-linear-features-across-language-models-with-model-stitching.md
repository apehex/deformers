Abstract
In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features between
models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their representations. We find
that small and large models learn similar representation spaces, which motivates
training expensive components like SAEs on a smaller model and transferring to a
larger model at a FLOPs savings. In particular, using a small-to-large transferred
SAE as initialization can lead to 50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs
on larger models. Next, we show that transferred probes and steering vectors
can effectively recover ground truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into
feature-level transferability, finding that semantic and structural features transfer
noticeably differently while specific classes of functional features have their roles
faithfully mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have continually proven to be surprisingly intricate next token
predictors that become more complex yet predictably better with scale [Kaplan et al., 2020], leaving a
desire to characterize and explain the LLM’s computations [Saphra and Wiegreffe, 2024, Olah et al.,
2020]. Despite increasing efforts to study the rich internal mechanisms and representations of LLMs,
the full computations still remain opaque [Sharkey et al., 2025, Engels et al., 2024].
A popular perspective to view the internal computation of LLMs is through the lens of features, or
functions of the input that serve a downstream purpose like predicting the next token or composing to
form model circuits [Olah et al., 2020, Huben et al., 2024]. The Linear Representation Hypothesis
(LRH) posits that these features are represented as directions in a high dimensional space [Park
et al., 2024, Elhage et al., 2022]. However, the features had been empirically observed to appear
in superposition (activating with interference), making interpretation of residual stream activations
difficult. Sparse dictionary learning methods [Olshausen and Field, 1996, Faruqui et al., 2015, Serre,
2006] such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently gained popularity for interpreting models
through this lens by disentangling dense representations into sparsely activating feature sets [Huben
et al., 2024, Bricken et al., 2023, Gao et al., 2025, Kissane et al., 2024]. A second hypothesis, Strong
Model Universality [Li et al., 2015], predicts that good models learn the same data representations.

Figure 1: Overview of the main methodologies. (a) We train two affine mappings T↑,↓concurrently
to map between the residual streams of two language models A and B. The mappings T↑,↓are then
used to transfer (b) the weights of entire SAEs from A to B, which (c) give better initializations that
save compute when training SAEs on B. The approximate “scaling law” for SAE training is shifted
to the left when training from the transferred initialization, capturing the intuition that the transferred
initialization saves the work of relearning shared features. More generally, the stitches can be used to
transfer (d) arbitrary vectors (probes, steering vectors) between the residual stream spaces.
While it is unlikely that the strongest versions of these hypotheses faithfully reflect how these models
work (that is, every feature is represented as a direction and every feature should be represented
universally across good models) [Engels et al., 2025b, Csordás et al., 2024, Wei et al., 2022], there is
significant evidence to support weaker versions of both hypotheses: linear features have been used to
probe and intervene on model representations [Zou et al., 2023, Panickssery et al., 2023, i.a.] and
are the fundamental idea underlying SAEs. One form of evidence for universality is model stitching,
which learns a transformation mapping the latent spaces of two models [Lenc and Vedaldi, 2015,
Bansal et al., 2021]. If the transformation is sufficiently simple, then it is claimed that the models
encode information similarly. Other evidence includes recent work in “model diffing” [Lindsey et al.,
2024] using crosscoders, a variant of SAEs, and transferring SAEs between base and chat models
[Kissane et al., 2024] to study the effects of post-training.
Our work relies on the ansatz that if two models represent enough features as directions in similarly
organized spaces, we should be able to transfer interpretable linear features between them. We
propose the use of model stitches as the mappings for learned representations between language
models. Our contributions (Figure 1) can be summarized as follows:
1. We learn stitches to transfer SAEs (§3) trained on one model to another, which are used
to initialize SAE training runs on larger models with those trained on smaller ones (§3.1),
allowing for an 50% FLOPs savings. We also demonstrate that stitches can be used to
transfer probes and steering vectors (§4).
2. The stitches are affine mappings trained on within-family model pairs in Pythia [Biderman
et al., 2023], GPT2 [Radford et al., 2019], and Gemma-2 [Team et al., 2024]. We find
downstream metrics are preserved by the mappings, supporting weak universality (§2).
3. We perform a fine-grained analysis on feature transfer and analyze how well semantic and
structural features transfer using the stitch (§5.1). We also find SAE features representing
well-known universal functional features and note their transferability (§5.2).

Language Model Stitching
We would like to learn a mapping from the residual stream of language model A to model B at some
layers, such that computation can start in the layers of A and finish in B (see Figure 1a). As notation,
let LMℓ(t) ∈RdLM denote the representation in model LM of input token(s) t which has hidden state
dimension dLM at layer ℓ. Model stitching learns a mapping T (the stitch) between two model-layer

losses on OpenWebText. All activations are taken before the layer’s computation. We primarily stitch
from middle residual layers but for specific use cases (e.g., steering) we stitch between 3/4 of the
depth. The losses are computed stitching from A to B, B to A, A to B back to A, and B to A back
to B. We calculate relative losses to the model that comes last and color code with blue and purple
for model A and model B respectively.


T ◦AℓA
(t) ≈BℓB(t) where ◦is function
composition. The existence of such a mapping T relies on at least weak universality, especially if T
preserves the hypothesis classes of model A and B. We are interested in the particular case when
A and B are decoder-only language models from the same family (trained on the same data) but
dB ≥dA. In this setup (visualized in Figure 1a), we will consider the two stitching mappings T↑,
which maps “up” from A to B, and T↓, which maps “down” from B to A. Furthermore, we will
assume that both T↑and T↓are affine transformations:
T↑: RdA →RdB,
hA 7→hAP↑+ b↑,
(1)
T↓: RdB →RdA,
hB 7→hBP↓+ b↓,
(2)
where hA and hB are activations from A and B, P↑∈RdA×dB, b↑∈RdB, P↓∈RdB×dA, and
b↓∈RdA. Ideally, we would like T{↑,↓} to be faithful to the downstream objective (i.e., language
modeling). In practice, training directly on the next-token prediction objective would involve
backpropagating gradients over the back halves of A and B, which is unnecessarily expensive. We
find that the reconstruction mean squared error (MSE) is a sufficient training objective to align the
models. Despite the dimensionality gap, we also still desire “almost”-invertible transformations i.e.
T↑◦T↓should be close to an identity and vice versa. Therefore, we also introduce a regularization
penalty that encourages T↑and T↓to invert each other with relative strength α, finding that the penalty
improves fidelity (ablation in §A.2) and has further motivation when we consider transferring SAEs
in §3.1 and §B.1. Formally, we train T↑and T↓concurrently via the loss function on a token t

We always learn the mappings from a fixed residual stream layer of model A to the layer in model
B that maximizes the average correlation from Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) across a small sample of model activations [Raghu et al., 2017] (more details in §A.1).
Using this procedure, the model-layer pairs that we stitch between are shown in Table 1.
Downstream Performance.
In Table 1, we compute the downstream fidelity of mapping from
A to B, mapping from B to A, and mapping in both inverse directions. First, we observe that
next-token prediction performance is close to ground truth, supporting a weak universality hypothesis
that models trained on the same data share features despite differing scales. However, we also find
that downstream performance is consistently bottlenecked by the worse (generally smaller) model
A. This result suggests that the gap between how A and B use their latent spaces prevents linear
stitching between A and B from recovering the full performance of B. Finally, the inverse operation
can be nearly lossless despite the intrinsic dimension mismatch prohibiting perfect invertibility.

Transferring SAEs
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently resurfaced in interpretability as a method of decomposing
residual stream representations x ∈Rd from a language model LM at layer ℓinto sparse nonnegative
feature activations f(x; θ) ∈RM, with M ≫d and θ = (We, be, Wd, bd) of the encoder matrix,
encoder bias, decoder matrix, and decoder bias respectively that specify the affine transformations in
the forward pass, given as
f(x; θ) = σ(xWe + be),

SAE(x; θ) = f(x; θ)Wd + bd =

the decoder matrix are the decoding/representation directions of the features that the SAE decomposes
into. Feature i activates on token t if fi

> 0. SAEs are trained to reconstruct x while
having sparse activations via an objective function consisting of MSE between x and SAE(x; θ) and,
depending on the architecture, an Lp regularization (usually with p = 1) on f(x; θ) with strength
controlled via a parameter λ > 0, respectively. We use pretrained SAEs with TopK activation [Gao
et al., 2025] for Pythia1 and JumpReLU SAEs for Gemma [Lieberum et al., 2024] and train TopK
SAEs from scratch on the GPT2 models using SAELens [Bloom et al., 2024].2
3.1
Efficient SAE Transfer
Equipped with the trained stitch transformations, we make a key observation that an SAE with
parameters θ = (We, be, Wd, bd) trained on layer ℓA in A can be transferred to layer ℓB in B. This
procedure is illustrated in Figure 1b - specifically, for a latent hB = BℓB(t) in model B, we (1)
transfer down using T↓, (2) apply the original SAE parameterized by θ, and (3) transfer back up using
T↑. Because all the transformations are affine, this forward computation exactly specifies a new SAE
on model B parameterized by
θ′ = (W ′
e, b′
e, W ′
d, b′
d) = (P↓We, b↓We + be, WdP↑, bdP↑+ b↑).
(6)
This relationship is derived in detail in §B.1. The explicit formulas for θ′ also provide geometric
intuition for the parameters of T{↑,↓}. Indeed, P{↑,↓} can be viewed as directly transforming the
linear feature spaces of A and B as they impact the feature vectors through W ′
e and W ′
d. On the other
hand, b{↑,↓} are responsible for adjusting the “position” of the feature decomposition as they only
alter the biases b′
e and b′
d.
We report evaluations of the transferred SAEs in §C, which are better than random but certainly worse
than a fully trained SAE on B (e.g., a Fraction Unexplained Variance [FUV] of 0.21 to 0.42 in Gemma
2B to 9B). The metrics serve as evidence of weak universality in the midst of a representational gap
between A and B. As a partial explanation, we note that the weight matrices of the transferred SAE
are still rank ≤dA < dB i.e., the SAE is only detecting and writing to features along a rank dA
subspace embedded within the rank dB ambient embedding space of model B, contributing to their
lackluster performance.
Training from a Stitch is More Efficient.
After obtaining a transferred SAE on B, we investigate
how much continued training is required to match the performance of an SAE fully trained on
model B. This question leads to a key application of the stitch and implicitly weak universality:
the transferred SAE can be used to initialize a new SAE in model B, “saving” the compute of
having to relearn features that transfer well. Concretely, consider the problem of training one SAE
for two models of different sizes in the same family [Lieberum et al., 2024]. The straightforward
approach is to separately train a SAE from scratch on each model. However, we find that given a
fully trained SAE on the small model, training a stitch and using the transferred small model SAE
1https://github.com/EleutherAI/sparsify
2Gao et al. [2025] releases pretrained TopK SAEs for GPT2. However, since these SAEs use a LayerNorm
normalization scheme but our stitches are trained on unnormalized residual stream activations, the SAE transfer
computation does not extend as easily.

Figure 2: (a) In the Pythia model pair, transferred SAE initialization adjusted by the stitch FLOP
count reaches explained variance thresholds in less FLOPs. For thresholds around 90% explained
variance, the moving average of explained variance of the SAE hits the threshold in around 30-50%
less FLOPs. (b) Features when trained from stitched initialization have higher cosine similarity to
their initial state than random initialization in the M = 32768 runs. Dead features are removed from
consideration for clarity around 1.0.
in the initialization scheme of the larger SAE allows for training of a comparable SAE to training
from scratch but in a cheaper total FLoating point OPerations (FLOPs) budget. We support this
claim by training TopK SAEs on the Pythia model pair and repeat with GPT2 in §D.1. We estimate
FLOP counts based on the assumption that activations are cached prior to training both the stitch and
the SAEs. All SAEs are trained using SAELens [Bloom et al., 2024] and other training and FLOP
estimation details are included in §D.
Generally, we find that the cost of training the stitch on cached activations is much cheaper compared
to training an SAE. Despite the cheap cost of the stitch, it allows us to stop the training of the SAE
earlier when we use the transferred SAE as initialization. Figure 2a displays the relative FLOPs-to-hit-
threshold savings of training from the transfer SAE initialization (accounting for the cost of training
the stitch) vs. training from scratch initialization. More specifically, for the two initializations, we
compare the number of FLOPs needed to get an SAE on Pythia-160m with explained variance above
a particular threshold. At high explained variance values, we collect savings of between 30%-50%
less FLOPs.
In Figure 1c we repeat the experiment for various latent sizes to create an approximate scaling law plot
inspired by Gao et al. [2025]. We emphasize our fit is only an approximation meant for visualization
as we estimate the law as a simple linear regression in log-log space instead of a proper scaling law
(details and coefficients in §D.2) - we ignore the irreducible loss term because we are comparing
the two laws against each other and stably fitting the term requires larger latent sizes to saturate the
curve. Nonetheless, when training from stitch initialization, the fitted law is noticeably shifted to
the left compared to random initialization, indicating that the stitch initialization reaches levels of
reconstruction loss relatively faster consistently across the given latent sizes. For small latent sizes,
such a procedure is less worth the additional compute of training the stitch, as adding in the compute
required to train the stitch would result in the procedure becoming more expensive than just training
from scratch. To confirm our intuition about the initialization, we also compute cosine similarities of
decoder vectors at the final checkpoint to their original direction at initialization. In Figure 2b, we
observe that the features trained from stitch initialization rotate less in aggregate than training from
random, indicating the initialization is indeed placing features closer to their final values.

Downstream Applications
Despite SAEs not transferring without additional training, the mappings T↑and T↓are fundamentally
general transformations that linearly relate the residual streams of two models. In this section, we
examine the application of the stitch to transferring probes and steering vectors, which target specific
vectors in the residual stream (Figure 1d). When applicable, following the intuition gained from
Equation 6, we transfer feature vectors using just P↑,↓and do not include the bias.

Figure 3: (a) Evaluations of transferred probes stitching from pythia-70m-deduped to pythia-160m-
deduped averaged over 8 binary classification datasets. If the probe is retrained (orange), we almost
recover ground truth performance (blue) across all probing ks and most datasets. Even if probe is
not retrained, in most datasets we are able to probe significantly better than random (green). When
directly probing on the residual stream, we find that transferring a probe trained on 70m-deduped
(dotted) reaches similar accuracy to a probe trained on 160m-deduped (dashed) without retraining. (b)
Response language steering vectors are able to be transferred between gemma-2-2b.20 and gemma-2-

truth steering, and steering using a transferred vector averaged over all languages L in EuroParl and
prompts. (c) The relative transfer gap distribution is bimodal with concentrations at 0 and 1, implying
the transfer steering works well for some languages but poorly for others.
Probing.
To begin, we consider the sparse probing task [Gurnee et al., 2023, Kantamneni et al.,
2025, Karvonen et al., 2025] - specifically, using a certain subset of k SAE features as probing features
for a binary concept. The k features are selected from the features found by a SAE and are selected
via a simple max mean activation difference procedure: feature activations are collected over training
samples, averaged over non-padding tokens, and the class-wise difference in means is computed. The
k features with largest difference in means are used as the probing features. Formally, let D+ and
D−be the set of activations at a layer on positive and negative training examples respectively. Then,
we compute the set Fk of indices of the k features as
Fk = argTopKi
Ex+∼D+[fi(x+; θ)] −Ex−∼D−[fi(x−; θ)]

.
(7)
In order to probe model B, we can transfer the SAE from A to B and use the activations from the
same k features in Fk to probe B. This procedure is equivalent to computing T↓(BℓB(t)), then
applying a probe on Fk’s activations on the stitched residual stream. Notably, the probe we use can
either be completely reused as a pure evaluation of the stitch (i.e. the same probe that we trained
when probing model A) or retrained to extract the full probing capability of the transferred features.
In Figure 3a, we present the test accuracies for probes averaged across 8 SAEBench datasets for
k = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50]. The results for all datasets presented separately is in §E. We compare against
baselines of selecting features from a ground truth SAE, random features, and dense representations
in model B. On average, we are able to probe successfully using the transferred features without
retraining the probe - in particular, we do not collect activations from model B outside of the data
used to train the stitch. These results also hold with dense probes shown in the dashed and dotted lines:
the dashed line is the skyline of training a probe on the dense representation of pythia-160m-deduped,
whereas the dotted line is a probe trained on the dense representation of pythia-70m-deduped zero-shot
applied to down-stitched residual streams from pythia-160m-deduped.
Steering/Instruction Following.
In this section, we explore transferring steering vectors in a simple
task: altering the response language from en to a target language L in EuroParl [Koehn, 2005]. We
compute a steering vector over the first 100 paired examples in each en-L dataset by unit-normalizing
the difference in mean activation on L tokens vs. English tokens [Panickssery et al., 2023]. To steer,
we clamp the component in the feature’s direction to ¯z, where we set ¯z to the mean of ⟨LMℓ(t), v⟩
over the tokens in L (i.e., positive examples of the desired behavior). Explicitly, if v is a steering
vector and ∥v∥2 = 1, then we steer by modifying the hidden state at a token t as
c = ¯z −⟨LMℓ(t), v⟩,
(8)
LMℓ(t)′ = LMℓ(t) + cv.
(9)
6

## Page 7

v is transferred by computing vP{↑,↓}, renormalizing, and recomputing ¯z in the new model. We
evaluate over a subset of 163 prompts from the IFEval dataset with the instructions stripped and
aggregate the proportion of responses in the target language [Zhou et al., 2023, Stolfo et al., 2025].
Importantly, none of the prompts explicitly request the response to be in the target language.
We use the Gemma model pair and present the results in Figure 3b, where we plot the % of responses
in the target language depending on the type of intervention: no steering, steering with a vector
learned from the current model, and steering with a transferred vector learned from the other model.
Averaged over L, we find that the transferred steering vector identifies a direction that successfully
steers the model toward responding in the target language without explicit prompt instruction to do so.
We break down the overall accuracy into individual language pairs (en, L) and find the transferred
steering vector works well for some languages but not for others by defining a clipped relative transfer
gap as the ratio of transfer steering performance to ground truth steering performance clipped to [0, 1]
for visualization (Figure 3c). We also note a positive correlation between language frequency and
steering transfer effectiveness (§F.1). Although language steering appears to work somewhat well,
we find that steering for general format instruction following has weaker results (§F.2).

Feature Analysis
Finally, we can gain intuition into specifically what features transfer well under the stitch. To this end,
we consider a correlation-based metric that approximates activation and downstream effect similarity
Bricken et al. [2023]. In particular, we compute the Pearson correlation between attribution scores
induced by the logit weights and the model’s next token predictions. Let Corr(·, ·) denote the Pearson
correlation operator over data x and let vi and v′
i denote the logit weights given by unembedding the
ith decoder vectors from Wd and W ′
d respectively. The attribution correlation is given by
Corrtτ

AℓA(tτ); θ

vi,tτ+1,A, fi

v′

(10)
where the correlation is computed over a set of tokens tτ ∈D and tτ+1 is the next token. Intuitively,
this score approximates the feature’s importance in generating the next token prediction by taking
the product of the activation and the downstream logit weight. We plot the histograms of attribution
correlation scores against random SAEs in §G.
5.1
Semantic vs. Structural features
The first question we can pose is whether different types of features are transferred relatively
differently according to the metric in Equation 10. The simplest classes of features are semantic
features vs. structural/syntactic features. We outline a cheap but general experiment to generate
this separation, visualized in Figure 4a with example classifications in Table 8. We first construct
a synthetic dataset consisting of augmented versions of sentences drawn from a large text corpus.
For each randomly drawn sentence, we use another LLM to generate k augmented versions of the
sentence with a prompt specifically instructing the LLM to ablate the semantic content of the sentence
while maintaining the structure (§H.1). We then feed the original sentence and all augmented versions
(1 + k sentences in total) into the original language model and collect which SAE features activate
on any token in the prompts. Features that activate consistently across the augmented versions of the
same prompt are classified as structural, whereas all other features are classified as semantic. This
classification is stitch-agnostic - we classify the features purely based on activations from the original
SAE. As a concrete example, suppose we began with the prompt “I bought apples, bananas, and
pears.” We generate an augmented version of this prompt that preserves the structure of the sentence
but ablates semantic content e.g. “John fostered cats, dogs, and fish.” Consider a feature that activates
on the last comma of a list: this feature would activate in both prompts, resulting in classification as a
structural feature. However, a feature that activates on food or animals would only activate on one of
the prompts or the other, resulting in classification as a semantic feature.
We plot the histograms of structural vs. semantic features with respect to the attribution correlation in
Figure 4b for the GPT2 stitch, removing all dead features from consideration. Our main observation
is that structural features tend to consistently transfer better, but semantic features are more polarized:
they generally transfer well or they do not. Directly, this result implies that the stitch strongly
transfers a group of semantic features, mostly transfers structural features, and leaves behind some
semantic features. This experiment also supports that new dimensions in larger models could be

mostly allocated to developing increasingly specific semantic directions whereas the core language
modeling spaces (which are more structural) remain similar.
5.2
Functional Features
Some of the structural features are related to known examples of universal features: in particular,
entropy features and attention deactivation features [Gurnee et al., 2024]. We find that our stitch
preserves the functional role of these features.
Entropy Features.
Entropy features are characterized by large norm and high composition with
the effective null space (we define as the bottom 2% of singular values) of the unembedding matrix
[Stolfo et al., 2024]. In gpt2-small, we find two features from an SAE that have these properties.
Furthermore, we find that even after stitching, these properties still hold true (Figure 5)a, showing
that the stitch does indeed transfer the functional role of these features.
Attention Deactivation Features.
In order to identify attention deactivation neurons, we use the
heuristic score and path patching techniques from Gurnee et al. [2024]. In particular, to identify
potential candidates for composition of a feature with a downstream attention head, we compute
the heuristic score between all features and downstream attention heads. Then, to test a relationship
between a feature and attention head, we path zero-ablate the feature’s contribution to a target
attention head’s input at the current token over a small token set and measure the change in the
attention pattern to the <bos> token. We identify an attention deactivation feature in the gpt2-small
SAE and find that it retains its role as a deactivation feature for a downstream head post-transfer
to gpt2-medium (Figure 5b). Attention sinks have also been noted to have large components to the
effective null space [Cancedda, 2024] and we find that is preserved as well (original: 0.27, stitch:
0.77). Somewhat mysteriously, we also observe the same feature acting as an attention activation
feature in gpt2-medium after transfer (Figure 16).

Language Model Representations.
Language models have empirically been observed to learn
vector representations of familiar human interpretable concepts like function application, truthfulness,
factual knowledge, and refusal [Todd et al., 2024, Gurnee and Tegmark, 2024, Zou et al., 2023, Arditi
et al., 2024]. Linear directions can also be useful for model editing, steering, and concept erasure
[Li et al., 2023, Ilharco et al., 2023, Panickssery et al., 2023, Belrose et al., 2023]. [Huben et al.,
2024, Bricken et al., 2023] reintroduced SAEs as a technique for decomposing residual streams

which are hypothesized to geometrically superpose features [Elhage et al., 2022, Arora et al., 2018,
Olah et al., 2020]. SAEs have been somewhat successfully applied to various downstream tasks
like steering, probing, circuit analysis, and discovering interesting features [Karvonen et al., 2025,
Ameisen et al., 2025, Ferrando et al., 2025, Marks et al., 2025]. Training SAEs has seen significant
research effort, especially in architectural design and activation functions [Rajamanoharan et al.,
2024, Gao et al., 2025, Bussmann et al., 2025]. Recently, however, limitations of SAEs have come
into light and their use cases have become better understood [Paulo and Belrose, 2025, Chanin et al.,
2025, Kantamneni et al., 2025, Engels et al., 2024]. In particular, a consistent assumption across
many aforementioned works is the linearity of features [Mikolov et al., 2013, Park et al., 2024, Elhage
et al., 2022]. However, recent work has demonstrated the existence of natural nonlinear features
[Engels et al., 2025b, Csordás et al., 2024].
Universal Representations Across LMs.
The intuition that well-generalizing models might all
have similar representations has existed for quite some time [Li et al., 2015, Huh et al., 2024]. Model
universality has been studied from the perspective of model stitching [Lenc and Vedaldi, 2015, Bansal
et al., 2021, Jha et al., 2025, Csordás et al., 2025], representation similarity measures like SVCCA and
CKA [Raghu et al., 2017, Kornblith et al., 2019, Barannikov et al., 2021], SAEs and variants [Lindsey
et al., 2024, Lan et al., 2024], and feature/neuron/weight level analysis [Gurnee et al., 2024, Stolfo
et al., 2024]. It has also been leveraged in adversarial attack literature [Zou et al., 2023]. Recently,
transfer of steering vectors between models of different sizes using linear mappings between the final
residual streams has also been explored in binary steering tasks and safety applications [Lee et al.,
2025, Oozeer et al., 2025].

Conclusion
Findings.
We find that we can faithfully stitch between language models of different sizes of the
same family, which can be leveraged to transfer SAEs, probes, and steering vectors. The SAEs can
be trained to convergence faster than training from scratch, demonstrating an application that uses
weak universality to benefit SAE training. Probes and steering vectors can also be transferred with no
additional training in specific cases. Finally, we perform a case study on GPT2 and find differences
between how the stitch transfers semantic and structural features and discover that specific functional
features have their roles preserved.
Limitations and Future Work.
First, we only train the stitches on general internet text data
between models in the same family with the same tokenizer. Natural follow ups are verifying the
findings in a cross-family setting and finetuning the stitch to reconstruct unnaturally occurring special
tokens or chat-templated data. The scaling laws are also theoretically incomplete because we lacked
high-compute regime data to fit the irreducible loss. However, the transfer procedure is generalizable
and other applications of the stitches to save compute or distill capabilities should be explored. For
example, stitching could be used to transfer linear weight updates like LoRAs [Hu et al., 2022] which
play nicely with the affine stitches and have already been established as similar to steering behavior
[Engels et al., 2025a].

The semantic/structural classification is also imperfect - we only gain one type of distinction which is
also sometimes noisy because the ablations are generated by another language model and transfer-
ability is purely correlational. A closer analysis of sensitivity of the stitching and semantic/structural
methodology to different layers could also produce new insights into feature distributions. Finally,
the probing and steering experiments deserve to be expanded upon to examine robustness as our
experiments are still limited to particular tasks and settings.

Stitch Training Details
The stitch training methodology is quite minimal. For the training dataset, we collect activations at
the desired layers in both models over the first 180k samples of OpenWebText with a context size
of 512 (128 for Gemma due to compute constraints) and evaluate over the next 1k samples with
the same context size. We mask out all special tokens. The stitches themselves are two separate
Linear layers (with biases initialized to 0) that map between the dimensions of A and B. We use
the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and clip gradient norms to 1.0. We found minimal
sensitivity to learning rate schedule, so we just use a cosine annealing decay, and found that 2 epochs
is sufficient for convergence (though even 1 is probably enough).
A.1
Layer Selection
Suppose we have fixed some layer ℓA in model A that we would like to stitch from. We determine
the layer ℓB by computing a Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) over a small
sample of tokens between the residual stream activations at ℓA and the candidate layer ℓB and taking
the argmax. We use SVCCA because it is cheap to over a small set of activations while being directly
related to how linearly related the two sets of activations accounting for noise in lower variance
directions. We visualize all pairwise SVCCA values computed in Figure 6.

Figure 7: Strength of inversion ablation experiment. For various values of α we plot downstream
next token CE loss for different transformations that should all be low - stitching from A to B and
from B to A, inversions, and the delta loss of an SAE transferred up from A to B. We can see that
α = 1.0 strikes a good balance so we use it for all experiments.
RdA×dB × RdB and T↓= (P↓, b↓) : RdB×dA × RdA as in Equation 1 that relate the residual streams
of A and B at fixed layers in both models.
B.1
SAE Methodology
Recall that a SAE : RdA →RdA defined on model A can be written using the following computation:
SAE(x; θ) = σ(xWe + be)Wd + bd,
(11)
parameterized by the 4-tuple θ = (We, be, Wd, bd) and an activation function σ.
The insight is that we can think of transferring a sparse autoencoder from model A to model B as
capturing the following computation. For every latent in model B hB ∈RdB:
1. Stitch hB to A using T↓.
2. Apply the SAE on the stitched latent.
3. Stitch the reconstruction back to B using T↑.
It turns out this computation can be collapsed into a reparameterized SAE on model B because all of
the transformations are affine.
(T↑◦SAE ◦T↓)(hB) = SAE(hBP↓+ b↓; θ)P↑+ b↑
=

σ([hBP↓+ b↓]We + be)Wd + bd

P↑+ b↑
= σ(hB[P↓We] + [b↓We + be])[WdP↑] + [bdP↑+ b↑]
= SAE(hB; θ′),
where
θ′ = (P↓We, b↓We + be, WdP↑, bdP↑+ b↑)
(12)
is another sparse autoencoder, but now mapping from RdB →RdB. Remark: one slight caveat is that
SAE′’s feature matrices are still only rank dA.
Observe that the matrices P↑and P↓do the grunt work in manipulating the actual feature spaces,
whereas the biases b↑and b↓are just relocating the “position” of the residual stream in space and do
not adjust the feature spaces themselves.
We also notice that assuming SAE(x; θ) ≈x, the reconstruction loss
∥SAE(hB; θ′) −hB∥2
(13)
is low when T↑and T↓invert each other (as expected). This inspires the inclusion of the additional
inversion penalty in training the transformations T↑and T↓(Equation 3).

Probes and Steering Vectors
To transfer a linear probe from A to B, we simply apply the probe on the down-stitched residual
stream T↓(BℓB(t)). If the probe is linear and has normal direction w, it is equivalent to using the
vector wP T
↓in B. Steering vectors are just transferred directly using P↑without the bias.
C
Zero-Shot SAE Evaluations
As basic evaluations of how well the feature spaces match, we can compute some core metrics of
our zero shot transferred SAEs and compare them against the original SAEs. We report L0, Fraction
of Unexplained Variance (FUV), Delta loss, and dead features % in Table 2. Importantly, we note
that the transferred SAEs are not perfect - one explanation of why is that the weight matrices of the
transferred SAE (Equation 6) are still rank ≤dA.
D
SAE Training and FLOP Estimation Details
All SAEs we train are TopK SAEs trained using SAELens on unnormalized residual stream activations.
We train SAEs with latent sizes 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, and 65536. We abide by the following
practices:
1. We normalize the decoder vectors to unit norm each iteration.
2. When randomly initializing, we initialize the decoder and encoder as transposes of each
other.
3. We use a constant learning rate schedule and just use 0.0001 as the learning rate.
4. We do not use an auxiliary loss for ease of FLOPs estimation (discussed below).
SAELens includes the auxiliary loss for TopK training by default. In order to work around disabling
it, we set the dead_feature_window parameter to an arbitrarily large number so that dead feature
computations are never run during training.
We estimate FLOP counts of training the stitches and SAEs with cached activations by simply
computing the FLOPs of one forward and backward pass for the desired module on a batch of dummy
data inside of the context manager torch.utils.flop_counter.FlopCounterMode. We then
scale by the number of training iterations. Example FLOP estimates for a set of SAEs is shown
in 3. As a minor fact, we do find that with larger latent sizes, the number of dead features in the
Table 3: FLOPs estimates for various important procedures with caching activations. All SAEs are
trained with sparsity k = 64 and width 32k. A full run is 4B tokens (120k iterations) for the SAEs
and 200M (36k iterations) tokens for the stitch. The Pythia-70m SAE is trained post layer 2 and the
Pythia-160m SAEs are trained post layer 3.

be inherited in the stitched SAE initialization, we end up with more dead features when training from
the stitched SAE initialization. This could be remediated by reincluding the auxiliary loss (which
would require careful FLOPs estimation), but we did not test this claim.
D.1
GPT2 SAE Transfer
In Figure 8, we replicate the same plots as Figure 1c but for the GPT2 series models, with SAEs
trained on 2B tokens and k = 32.
D.2
Scaling Law Fit
We fit the scaling law by sampling the frontier MSE achieved at various FLOPs thresholds and fitting
a linear model on the log-log scale (as opposed to fitting an irreducible loss term - unfortunately we do
not have enough high-FLOPs points due to compute constraints to fit a complete scaling law stably).
However, for our purposes, since theoretically the irreducible loss is the same for all initializations,
so purely for relative comparison between two scaling laws it is not crucial. This results in a law of
the form
L(C) ≈AC−β
(14)
instead of
L(C) ≈L∞+ AC−β
(15)
where L∞is the irreducible loss. We report the fitted coefficients for the approximate laws in Figure
1c (Pythia) and Figure 8a (GPT2) in Table 4.

to the Pythia results - we can probe better than random using transferred probes. Code and language
domains again seem hard to directly transfer but are fixed with retraining the probes.

Steering Experiment Details
We do feature selection and coefficient fitting over the first 250 samples from Europarl for the dataset.
To evaluate, we use langdetect to detect the most likely language of the response to the input
prompt. We compute confidence intervals using Clopper-Pearson intervals at the α = 0.05 level.
F.1
Specific Language Results
We report the full accuracies for all languages in Tables 5 and 6.
The clipped relative transfer gap is defined as
Clip

(16)
and we define 0/0 as 0 and ∞or −∞are clipped to 1 and 0 respectively.
We can compute a language frequency approximation by sentence-tokenizing a corpus of text and
using langdetect to classify the language of each sentence, counting the frequencies. In Figure 11,
we plot the clipped relative transfer gap against the language log frequency (computed over 100k
samples of OpenWebText) and identify a positive correlation with frequent languages having better
transfer performance.

2b Transfer vs. Training Frequency
Figure 11: A positive correlation exists between being more frequent in natural language training
data and having stronger transfer steering performance (relative to ground truth performance).
F.2
Other Steering Experiments
We also trained a stitch between gemma-2-2b-it.20 and gemma-2-9b-it.33 and computed steering
vectors for instruction following tasks directly following Stolfo et al. [2025]. The task setup involves
responding to prompts without explicit instructions formatted using chat templating. We then apply
a DiffMean steering vector at each token and verify whether the instruction is followed by the
response. We found weaker steering results - in no case did transfer steering improve upon ground
truth steering and small to big results are weak in general. In some cases, we find that ground truth
steering performance is matched and generally stitched steering can still provide improvements over
no steering whatsoever in some instructions.
Our current conjecture for why these results are much weaker than the response language results
is that the steering vector is computed on the final token of the input prompt. Previous tokens in
the input prompt include chat templating tokens like <[start,end]_of_turn>. The stitch is not
trained on these tokens (they do not naturally occur in OpenWebText for example) and thus does
not learn to properly reconstruct the important components of these tokens, which likely have very
complex underlying latent representations but are important for steering. Furthermore, as is clear
from the plots, the IFEval dataset is incredibly small so the confidence intervals are wide. The steering
vectors are probably noisy for the instructions that have few examples (about 10 pairs) and the noise
is compounded through transferring.

Attribution Correlation Histograms
We plot histograms of the attribution correlation metric for our model-layer pairs in Figure 14. We
plot the semantic/structural difference for Pythia and Gemma in Figure 15.

Semantic / Structural Augmentation
H.1
Prompt
We prompt gemma-2-9b-it 5 times with temperature 1.0 using the following prompt (generated
using GPT-4 and mildly edited), resulting in 6 versions of the same sentence. We use context size
128.
Transform the given sentence so that its meaning is completely unrelated,
but the syntax, punctuation, and grammatical structure remain identical.
This means:
- Keep all function words (e.g., "the," "and," "while") and punctuation (e.
g. commas, periods, brackets, parentheses, dashes) unchanged.
- Replace content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) with words from
entirely different semantic domains (e.g., "run" -> "melt", "dog" -> "
radio").

Figure 14: Attribution correlation histograms for three model stitches. We can see that for most
features we do much better than a random stitch. However, there are some straggling features that
appear to get either flipped or do not transfer well.

Figure 15: (Left) Pythia and (right) Gemma transfer differences between semantic and structural. We
find somewhat similar patterns to the GPT2 case, namely the transferability of structural features and
cluster of semantic features that do not transfer appears consistent. Since structural features naturally
tend to be higher density, the stitch is incentivized via the MSE penalty to preserve those directions of
space because there is higher variance in these dimensions and more consistently help reduce MSE.
