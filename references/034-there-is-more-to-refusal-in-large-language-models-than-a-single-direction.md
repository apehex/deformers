Abstract
Prior work argues that refusal in large language
models is mediated by a single activation-space
direction, enabling effective steering and ablit-
eration. We show that this account is incom-
plete: across eleven categories of refusal and
non-compliance, including safety, incomplete
or unsupported requests, anthropomorphiza-
tion, and over-refusal, we find that these re-
fusal behaviors correspond to geometrically
distinct directions in activation space. Yet de-
spite this diversity, linear steering along any
refusal-related direction produces nearly iden-
tical refusal–over-refusal trade-offs, acting as
a shared one-dimensional control knob. The
primary effect of different directions is not
whether the model refuses, but how it refuses.
Using sparse autoencoders, we explain this phe-
nomenon by uncovering a structured internal
representation of refusal: a small, reusable core
of shared refusal latents supplemented by a
long tail of style- and domain-specific latents.
Linear interventions collapse over this struc-
ture, flattening mechanistic differences into
uniform behavioral control. Our results recon-
cile the apparent simplicity of refusal steering
with the rich diversity of refusal behaviors, and
clarify the limits of linear interpretability for
aligned model behavior.

Introduction
A central objective in training large language mod-
els (LLMs) is to align their behavior with human
values such as helpfulness and harmlessness, while
accurately interpreting and responding to user in-
tent as expressed in a prompt (Hendrycks et al.,
2020; Askell et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Yao et al.,
2023). Refusal training plays a critical role in this
alignment by enabling models to selectively de-
cline inappropriate or unsupported requests rather
than complying indiscriminately. Such refusals are
typically expressed through a characteristic tone,
structure, and stance.
Figure 1: styles of refusals produced by steering along
four distinct refusal directions.
Prior work on instilling refusal behavior has pri-
marily emphasized safety, focusing on preventing
harmful or disallowed outputs (Ganguli et al., 2022;
Dai et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2024a; Yuan et al.,
2025). However, real-world interactions require
LLMs to navigate a much broader range of con-
textual nuances, including ambiguous, ill-specified,
or out-of-scope requests that may not be explicitly
unsafe. Given the fragility of alignment mecha-
nisms in LLMs, recent research has increasingly
focused on developing methods to analyze and de-
tect alignment failures, as well as to steer model
behavior toward appropriate non-compliance when
warranted (Bai et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024a).
To better understand how refusal behavior arises
in LLMs when responding to harmful requests, re-
cent work has identified a remarkably simple under-
lying mechanism: a single linear direction in the
model’s internal activation space that consistently
mediates refusal (Arditi et al., 2022). Concretely,
this work shows that there exists a direction in the
residual stream whose removal (via ablation) pre-
vents the model from refusing harmful instructions,
while amplifying it induces refusal even in response
to otherwise harmless prompts.
At the same time, refusal behavior does not ap-

pear simple at the surface level. Models refuse for
different reasons, across different domains, and in
noticeably different styles, see Fig. 1. This creates
a tension between the apparent simplicity of the
proposed mechanism and the diversity of refusal
behaviors observed in practice. In particular, the
proposed mechanism collapses diverse safety vio-
lations into a single behavioral class and does not
address whether it generalizes to other forms of
refusal beyond safety. This raises a critical open
question: do qualitatively different forms of re-
fusal—and more general non-compliance behav-
iors—rely on distinct underlying mechanisms?
To address this question, we adopt a broader
view of refusal as part of a wider class of non-
compliant behaviors that extend beyond safety
alone (Han et al., 2024b; Brahman et al., 2024; Xie
et al., 2025; Röttger et al., 2024). Building on prior
work, we consider refusals arising from incomplete
or indeterminate requests, unsupported requests
that exceed the model’s capabilities, humanizing
requests that anthropomorphize the model, unqual-
ified professional advice, potentially inappropriate
topics governed by contextual norms, traditional
safety refusals involving harmful content, and over-
refusals to benign requests. Together, these cat-
egories capture a broad spectrum of refusal and
non-compliance behaviors observed in real-world
interactions. We study these behaviors through lin-
ear interventions in activation space and find that
their associated directions are not geometrically
identical, suggesting potential differences in how
refusal behavior is expressed.
Despite these geometric differences, we find that
linear steering along any of these directions yields
similar refusal efficacy across model inputs: as
steering strength increases, the model increasingly
refuses prompts—including benign ones—across
datasets. Steering thus behaves like a single control
knob: turning it up pushes the model toward refusal
more often, largely independent of which refusal-
related direction is used. This suggests a different
understanding of refusal and non-compliance in
the model’s internal dynamics than one implied
by geometrically distinct directions. Where these
directions differ most is not in whether the model
refuses, but in how it refuses, ranging from explicit
policy-based refusals, to clarification or missing-
context responses, to softer forms of deflection.
To further examine the mechanistic origins of
these differences, we use sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) as an interpretability tool. We probe the
model for latents that systematically activate dur-
ing refusal and non-compliance at a fixed token
position, and we test their causal involvement by
amplifying the directions encoded by these la-
tents during generation. This confirms the same
single–behavioral-degree-of-freedom phenomenon
observed with activation-space steering. For each
refusal category, we verify that the residual-stream
directions encoded by the corresponding latents re-
semble those identified directly in activation space.
By analyzing the overlap of active latents across
refusal categories, we find that while a substan-
tial subset of latents is shared across refusal
types—forming a reusable refusal core—other la-
tents are specific to particular refusal styles. To
make this distinction concrete, we annotate a sub-
set of the most widely shared latents and show that
stylistic variation in refusal arises from a long tail
of more specialized features.
Overall, the internal structure of refusal is largely
invisible to linear control. Activation-space steer-
ing reveals what refusal looks like under interven-
tion, while SAE analysis helps explain why dif-
ferent steering directions behave so similarly and
which internal features are being jointly modulated.
Together, these perspectives describe different lev-
els of the same phenomenon: a structured internal
system whose complexity is flattened by simple
linear interventions.
We address in this work the following research
questions: We address in this work the following
research questions:
RQ1 How different are the refusal directions when
computed for different types of refusal behav-
ior beyond safety?
RQ2 How do these different directions get ex-
pressed in the latent space of the model such
that they facilitate various styles of refusal
under a very similar intervention mechanism?
RQ3 Do geometrically distinct refusal directions
lead to meaningfully different refusal behavior
when used for causal steering?
RQ4 Which aspects of refusal behavior are con-
trolled by linear interventions, and which as-
pects vary across refusal directions?
RQ5 To what extent are refusal-related latent fea-
tures shared across different refusal cate-
gories?

Methods
2.1
Identifying Refusal in Activation Space
A refusal direction is computed by contrasting
residual stream activations elicited by prompts la-
beled to require non-compliance with those elicited
by benign prompts. For each prompt set, we collect
residual stream activations at a fixed token position,
average them across prompts, and define the refusal
direction as the difference between these activation
vectors. This procedure yields a single activation-
space direction per evaluation split, which we use
for steering and ablation experiments.
Let xt ∈Rd denote the residual stream activa-
tion at token position t, and let r ∈Rd denote
the normalized refusal direction. Refusal induc-
tion is implemented by modifying activations as
x′
t ←xt + αr, where α > 0 controls the steering
strength. Refusal ablation is implemented by pro-
jecting out this component, x′
t ←xt −(xt · r) r.
These linear interventions enable direct causal tests
by selectively amplifying or suppressing refusal
behavior during generation, with their effects quan-
tified via changes in refusal rate, over-refusal rate,
and overall accuracy.
For each model, we select the steering strength
α by a simple grid search over a small discrete set
(e.g., α ∈{5, 10, 20, 30, 60}) on a held-out valida-
tion pool, choosing the smallest value that achieves
at least a 90% refusal rate on harmful prompts
while keeping benign over-refusals below a chosen
threshold. Unless otherwise noted, we report re-
sults for these selected α values (e.g., α = 60 for
gemma-2-9b-it in activation-space steering).
2.2
Identifying Refusal in SAE Space
Motivation.
We use sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
as an interpretability tool to decompose the refusal
directions identified in the activation space to their
sparse latent components. We follow the firing–rate
separation approach of Ferrando et al. (2024) to
identify refusal latents, test their causal involve-
ment, and study how the refusal directions are real-
ized in the model’s latent space.
SAE models and decision-state activations.
We
use pretrained JumpReLU residual-stream SAEs
from GEMMASCOPE (Lieberum et al., 2024b),
trained on gemma-2-9B-it and available for lay-
ers ℓ∈{9, 20, 31}1. For all SAE analyses, we
hook the residual stream at the token immediately
1hf.co/google/gemma-scope-9b-it-res
preceding the assistant’s response (position −2 in
the chat template), which we treat as the model’s
decision state. Let x(ℓ) ∈Rd denote this residual-
stream activation at layer ℓ. An SAE parameterizes
an encoder–decoder pair (fθ, gϕ) such that
z(ℓ) = fθ
x(ℓ)
,
ˆx(ℓ) = gϕ
z(ℓ)
,
(1)
where z(ℓ) ∈Rk is a sparse latent vector and each
latent j has an associated decoder direction d(ℓ)
j
in
the residual space.
Latent firing and refusal separation.
To iden-
tify refusal-associated latents, we adapt the firing-
rate separation method of Ferrando et al. (2024).
For latent j at layer ℓon example i, we define a
binary firing indicator:
a(ℓ)
ij = 1
h
z(ℓ)
ij > 0
i
,
(2)
where z(ℓ)
ij is the JumpReLU activation of latent
j. For each of our 11 refusal splits s and label
y ∈{refusal, non-refusal} with index set S(s)
y , we
compute the firing rate:
f(s)
j,ℓ(y) =
1
|S(s)
y |
X
i∈S(s)
y
a(ℓ)
ij ,
(3)
and define the refusal separation score as:
∆(s)
j,ℓ= f(s)
j,ℓ(refusal) −f(s)
j,ℓ(non-refusal).
(4)
For each split s and layer ℓ∈{9, 20, 31}, we rank
latents by ∆(s)
j,ℓand select the top-K with ∆(s)
j,ℓ> 0
as the refusal latents for that split. These layerwise
latent sets are the basic building blocks for all sub-
sequent SAE analyses (causal steering, ablations,
and cross-split reuse).
Constructing SAE-based refusal directions.
Each refusal latent j has a decoder direction d(ℓ)
j
in
residual space. For split s and layer ℓ, with refusal
latents {j1, . . . , jK}, we construct an SAE-based
refusal direction by averaging decoder directions:
d(s,ℓ)
SAE = 1
K
K
X
k=1
d(ℓ)
jk .
(5)
During generation, we apply steering at layer ℓby
modifying the residual stream as
x′ = x + β d(s,ℓ)
SAE ,
(6)
where β controls steering strength. This procedure
mirrors activation-space steering, but the direction
is explicitly grounded in a small bundle of SAE fea-
tures rather than a single mean-difference vector.

## Page 4

Ablations and control baselines.
To test neces-
sity, we perform SAE-based ablations by encoding
the decision-state activation x(ℓ), zeroing the se-
lected refusal latents in z(ℓ), and decoding back
into residual space to obtain an ablated activation
˜x(ℓ) = gϕ(˜z(ℓ)) that is used in place of x(ℓ) during
generation. As controls, we construct steering di-
rections from random latent subsets of the same
size K, and from random unit vectors in residual
space.

Data and Models
To capture a broad range of refusal and non-
compliance behaviors, we draw on four datasets
with complementary characteristics, from which
we construct 11 evaluation splits.
WildGuardMix (WGM)
provides ground-truth
safety annotations indicating whether prompts
should be complied with or declined under safety
policies;
from this dataset we construct the
SafetyCore–WGM split containing both safety-
sensitive and benign prompts.
SorryBench (SB)
organizes unsafe content into
four policy domains, from which we construct
four splits corresponding to hate speech genera-
tion (HateSpeech–SB), potentially inappropriate
topics (Inappropriate–SB), assistance with crimes
or torts (CrimeAssistance–SB), and unqualified
professional advice (Advice–SB).
CoCoNot
(CCN)
covers
contextual
non-
compliance beyond conventional safety cases;
we construct five splits capturing incomplete re-
quests (Incomplete–CCN), unsupported requests
(Unsupported–CCN),
indeterminate
requests
(Indeterminate–CCN),
humanizing
requests
(Humanizing–CCN), and safety-related requests
involving harmful content (Safety–CCN).
XSTest (XST)
targets over-refusal by contrast-
ing adversarially framed but benign prompts
with standard benign requests; we construct the
OverRefusal–XST split to study inappropriate re-
fusal on safe inputs. Additional dataset details are
provided in Appendix B.
Each evaluation split consists of a balanced pair
of prompt sets: at least 32 prompts labeled to elicit
non-compliant behavior under dataset annotations,
paired with an equal number of benign prompts
for which compliance is appropriate. Following
Arditi et al. (2022), we adopt 32 prompts per class
as a standard unit for estimating stable activation
centroids. When sufficient data is available, we
additionally construct multiple independent 32/32
splits without replacement, enabling validation of
within-category geometric stability.
Models:
We
run
all
experiments
on
two
instruction-tuned models: gemma-2-9b-it2 and
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct3. Activation-space di-
rections are computed from residual-stream ac-
tivations at a fixed mid-layer hook (resid_pre;
e.g.,
layer 20 for Gemma and layers 15–
16 for Llama).
For sparse-feature analy-
ses, we use publicly available residual-stream
SAEs (GemmaScope layers 9/20/31 and the
saes-llama-3.1-8b-instruct release4), focus-
ing on later layers where refusal-related features
are most pronounced. Activations are extracted at
the chat-template token immediately preceding the
assistant’s response (index −2), which we treat as
the model’s decision state.

Findings
4.1
Refusal Directions in Activation Space
In this section, we analyze refusal behavior directly
in activation space. For each of the 11 refusal splits,
we compute a corresponding refusal direction and
quantify similarity across splits using pairwise co-
sine distance. As shown in Table 1, many directions
are substantially dissimilar (typical cosine similar-
ity 0.4–0.6, with several near-orthogonal), indicat-
ing that different refusal categories correspond to
distinct activation-space directions.
Controlled test:
To evaluate whether these direc-
tions causally mediate refusal, we use a controlled
test set of 200 prompts balanced across prompt type
(harmful vs. benign) and the unsteered model’s re-
sponse (refusal vs. compliance). This yields four
equally sized subsets: HR, HC, BR, and BC. By
construction, the unsteered model achieves 50%
accuracy, since only refusals to harmful prompts
(HR) and compliance with benign prompts (BC)
are correct outcomes; HC and BR correspond to
jailbreaks and over-refusals, respectively.
Steering:
We steer the base model along each of
the 11 refusal directions and evaluate performance
on the controlled test set. Steering is applied at var-
ious strengths, ranging from weak to near-saturated

Table 1: Pairwise cosine similarity matrix between refusal directions learned from the 11 evaluation splits. The
direction of SafetyCore-WGM is the closest to the safety refusal direction of (Arditi et al., 2022).
WGM: WildGuard-Mix, CCN: CoCoNot, SB: SorryBench, XST: XSTest
refusal regimes as in Table 12. Steered responses
are labeled as refusals or compliant answers us-
ing WildGuard, with manual validation. We report
overall accuracy, refusal rate, and over-refusal rate.
Table 2 reports summary results for steering
and direction ablation of a safety-derived direction
for Gemma and Llama. Across splits and mod-
els, steering along different refusal directions pro-
duces broadly similar behavior: increasing steering
strength raises refusal rates on harmful prompts
while simultaneously increasing over-refusal on be-
nign prompts, with both approaching saturation at
high strength. A notable exception is CoCoNot non-
safety categories which respond more gradually
to steering. Direction ablation for Gemma shows
the complementary effect, suppressing refusal in
most cases, though CoCoNot-derived directions
leave residual refusal rates of approximately 0.3–
0.5, suggesting partial misalignment with safety
refusal mechanisms. Also, Llama does not respond
well to the safety direction ablation, suggesting
a richer internal refusal structure with redundant
paths that survived the ablation.
Despite these geometric differences, steered
models consistently refuse to answer prompted
questions, differing primarily in how refusal is ex-
pressed. As illustrated in Appendix A, humanizing
directions emphasize the model’s non-human na-
ture, incomplete-request directions produce terse
expressions of confusion, and indeterminate or un-
supported directions stress impossibility or lack of
agency. SorryBench directions foreground moral
judgments or professional disclaimers, while Wild-
Guard and XSTest directions emphasize safety, il-
legality, or harm.
Overall, these results indicate that refusal perfor-
mance is largely invariant across directions, while
refusal style varies substantially, consistent with
refusal acting as a simple behavioral switch with
stylistic degrees of freedom.
4.2
Refusal Directions in SAE Space
To probe refusal behavior at the level of internal
features, we analyze refusal in the latent space of
sparse autoencoders (SAEs). For the 11 data splits,
we identify refusal-associated SAE latents follow-
ing Section 2.2 and examine: (i) their behavior
under causal intervention, (ii) their alignment with
the activation-space refusal directions from Sec-
tion 4.1, (iii) the extent to which refusal latents are
reused across datasets, splits, and layers, and (iv)
the semantic themes these latents encode.
4.2.1
Latent-Space Steering
We test whether the refusal-associated SAE latents
are causally involved in refusal behavior, by ask-
ing whether steering in latent space recovers the
same one-dimensional refusal knob observed in
activation space. For each refusal split, we con-
struct a single SAE-based refusal direction by av-
eraging the decoder directions of the top-ranked
refusal latents (Section 2.2), then apply residual-
stream steering for the same controlled test set
from Section 4.1 during generation at layer ℓ, r′ =
r+β d(s,ℓ)
SAE . We choose the steering strength β using
a coarse grid search on the validation pool (Gemma:
β ∈{10, 30, 60}; Llama: β ∈{0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2}).
WildGuard is used again to label steered refusals
R′ or compliance C′.
Table 3 summarizes the performance of SAE-
based steering across splits for Gemma and Llama
(the underlying safety-tuned base model at β =
0 already exhibits substantial refusal and over-
refusal). Across all splits, increasing β monotoni-
cally raises refusal rates on harmful prompts and, in
parallel, over-refusal rates on benign prompts, trac-
ing out essentially the same accuracy–over-refusal
trade-off observed when steering directly in activa-

tion space. This shows that steering along a small
SAE-derived direction is sufficient to recover the
same one-dimensional refusal knob.
Control experiments using a random subset of
SAE latents confirm that this behavior is specific
to the identified refusal latents, produceing much
weaker, non-monotonic changes in refusal.
4.2.2
Alignment with Activation-Space
Refusal Directions
To quantify if activation-space refusal directions
can be reconstructed from the small set of refusal-
associated SAE latents, for each prompt we ob-
tain the SAE latent activations at the decision state
x(ℓ), filter for the top-ranked refusal latents (Sec-
tion 2.2), reconstruct their contribution in residual
space by summing the corresponding decoder di-
rections weighted by the latent activations, and
compute the cosine similarity between this recon-
structed direction and the corresponding activation-
space direction. We report the mean and standard
deviation of the cosine similarity over prompts
for each split in Table 4. Cosine similarity be-
tween SAE directions and activation-space direc-
tions is uniformly high across datasets and refusal
categories, typically in the range 0.85–0.97, indi-
cating good reconstruction. Despite the fact that
activation-space refusal directions are geometri-
cally distinct across datasets (Section 4.1), they ap-
pear to operate on substantially shared underlying
SAE features; this might help explain why steering
along different activation-space refusal directions
produces similar refusal efficacy.
4.2.3
Latent Overlaps Across Dataset Splits
To assess how much of the SAE refusal structure
is shared across datasets and splits, we rank latents
within each split by the difference in their firing
rates on high-risk (HR) versus base (BC) subsets
and retain the top 1000 latents per split.
For each layer, we count (i) how many distinct
latents appear in at least one of these lists, and
(ii) the latents that appear in for all the 11 splits.
These overlap statistics are summarized in Table 5,
while detailed latent–split incidence matrices and
top-shared-latent tables are given in Appendix F.
As the results show, the signal is sparse but con-
sistent: in all three layers, a relatively small subset
of latents carries most of the HR vs. BC discrimi-
nation signal with only about 8–10% and 2.5–4%
of the 16,384 latents ever appear in any top–1000
list or in all splits, respectively.
Secondly, there are robust cores of refusal la-
tents within each layer with strict intersections of
591, 517, and 421 latents for layers 9, 20, and 31,
respectively.
Third, there is a depth trend: the fraction of
latents that ever appear in a top–1000 list grows
slightly with depth (from ∼8.55% at layer 9 to
∼9.64% at layer 31), while the size of the strict
core shrinks (from ∼3.61% to ∼2.57%).
This
suggests that deeper layers distribute the HR vs.
BC signal over a somewhat larger basin, with a
smaller, more specialized subset that is truly uni-

Viewed together, we hypothesize a two-part
structure: a small, reusable core of refusal fea-
tures shared across tasks, and a larger long tail of
latents that appear only in one or few splits and
are more aligned with particular refusal styles (e.g.,
short “I don’t understand” replies) or domains (e.g.,
repeated legal disclaimers in unqualified advice).

consistently emerge regardless of dataset composi-
tion, representing domain-general refusal features
such as harmful content requests, prohibited/illicit
content, disinformation, and policy-violating direc-
tives (Table 15). In contrast, distinct latents emerge
only in specific subcategories: SorryBench’s harm-
focused splits surface latents specialized for oper-
ational harm detection (e.g., ridicule-focused ha-
rassment, coercive communications, crime facili-
tation), while CoCoNot’s capability-focused cat-
egories reveal latents for unsupported modalities
(e.g., visual art requests, audio transcription, fic-
tional language translation) and anthropomorphic
queries (e.g., personalized advice requests). Sev-
eral common latents also exhibit polysemy across
settings, receiving harm-focused interpretations in
SorryBench but capability-focused interpretations
in CoCoNot.

Related Work
Refusal Directions and Abliteration Attacks:
Prior work has shown that refusal behavior in large

## Page 8

language models can be strongly influenced by low-
dimensional structure in activation space. Arditi
et al. (2024) demonstrated that refusal is often medi-
ated by a dominant direction in the residual stream,
such that suppressing this direction inhibits refusal
on harmful prompts while amplifying it induces
refusal even for benign inputs. This finding led to
the development of abliteration attacks (Labonne,
2024), which exploit directional ablation to remove
refusal behavior from aligned models, with thou-
sands of such modified models now publicly avail-
able. Subsequent work has questioned the suffi-
ciency of a single-direction account: Zhang and
Sun (2025) decomposed refusal into distinct harm-
detection and refusal-execution directions, achiev-
ing high attack success rates through targeted inter-
ventions, while Wollschläger et al. (2025) showed
that refusal can be mediated by multiple indepen-
dent directions forming “concept cones,” introduc-
ing the notion of representational independence to
explain diverse intervention effects. Complemen-
tary mechanistic analyses by Kissane et al. (2024)
further reveal that base models already exhibit sub-
stantial refusal behavior and that refusal directions
transfer from instruction-tuned models, suggesting
that alignment fine-tuning amplifies preexisting cir-
cuitry rather than introducing refusal mechanisms
from scratch. Together, these findings motivate a
view of refusal as a structured but non-monolithic
phenomenon, in which multiple activation-space di-
rections can influence refusal behavior, potentially
in different ways.
Activation Steering and Representation En-
gineering:
Our activation-space methodology
builds on representation engineering (Zou et al.,
2023), which introduced contrastive extraction of
concept directions for behavioral control. Activa-
tion Addition (Turner et al., 2024) showed that such
directions can be applied at inference time to mod-
ulate behavior without optimization. Subsequent
work Panickssery et al. applied these techniques to
safety-relevant behaviors, demonstrating that prop-
erties like sycophancy and corrigibility correspond
to linear directions that compose additively with
RLHF effects. For robust safety interventions, cir-
cuit breakers (Zou et al., 2024b) train models to
reroute harmful representations to orthogonal sub-
spaces, while RepBend (Yousefpour et al., 2025)
achieves substantial reductions in attack success
rates through representation bending.
Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretability:
Our
SAE analysis leverages GemmaScope (Lieberum
et al., 2024a), which provides sparse autoencoders
trained on all layers of Gemma-2 models using
the JumpReLU architecture (Rajamanoharan et al.,
2024). This builds on foundational work demon-
strating that SAE features are significantly more
interpretable than individual neurons (Bricken
et al., 2023), with scaling studies revealing safety-
relevant features in production models (Temple-
ton et al., 2024). Recent work has begun connect-
ing SAEs specifically to refusal: Yeo et al. (2025)
found that harm and refusal are encoded as sepa-
rate feature sets, while O’Brien et al. (2024) iden-
tified steerable refusal features in Phi-3. Most rel-
evant to our cross-split analysis, Lee et al. (2025)
discovered a “hydra” refusal featrures that remain
dormant unless earlier features are suppressed, sug-
gesting the kind of distributed yet coordinated struc-
ture we observe.

Conclusion
We investigated the representational structure un-
derlying refusal behavior in large language mod-
els and found that refusal corresponds to multiple
stable and geometrically distinct directions in ac-
tivation space. Despite this diversity, linear inter-
ventions along different refusal-related directions
yield nearly identical behavioral trade-offs, primar-
ily controlling whether the model refuses while hav-
ing a visible effect on refusal style. Using sparse
autoencoders, we show that this collapse arises
from a shared set of reusable latent features that un-
derlie refusal across datasets, together with a longer
tail of style- and domain-specific features. Distinct
refusal directions can be understood as different
linear combinations of this shared latent structure,
explaining why linear steering reduces a rich in-
ternal representation to a single effective control
dimension. These findings reconcile prior results
on single-direction refusal control with evidence
of more complex internal structure, and highlight
a limitation of linear interpretability methods in
capturing the mechanisms underlying alignment-
relevant behaviors.
Limitations
Our analysis is conducted on two instruction-tuned
language models. While these models span differ-
ent architectures and training pipelines, we do not
evaluate whether the observed refusal mechanisms

## Page 9

persist in larger models, base (non–instruction-
tuned) models, or systems trained with substan-
tially different alignment procedures. As a result,
our findings should be interpreted as characterizing
refusal behavior within this model regime rather
than establishing universality across all large lan-
guage models.
Our sparse-feature analysis further depends on
the availability of publicly released sparse autoen-
coders (SAEs). Training SAEs at scale is compu-
tationally expensive, which restricts our analysis
to a limited set of layers and models for which
community-trained SAEs exist. This constraint
limits the resolution at which we can study refusal-
related features and may bias our analysis toward
later layers where SAE coverage is more common.
Potential Risks and Ethics Statement
This work analyzes the internal mechanisms un-
derlying refusal and non-compliance in large lan-
guage models and shows that refusal behavior can
be modulated through low-dimensional linear in-
terventions. These findings carry potential risks,
as similar techniques could be misused to suppress
refusal behavior and facilitate the generation of
harmful content. We mitigate this risk by focus-
ing on analysis rather than deployment, using es-
tablished safety benchmarks, and emphasizing the
limitations and brittleness of linear control.
Our results highlight that linear steering col-
lapses a rich internal refusal structure into a coarse
behavioral knob, underscoring that such interven-
tions are not suitable as principled safety mecha-
nisms. All experiments use existing public datasets
and moderation tools, without introducing new
harmful content. We acknowledge the dual-use
nature of interpretability research and view this
work as motivating more robust, feature-level ap-
proaches to alignment rather than enabling safety
circumvention.

A
Refusal Style Examples Across
Directions
We illustrate how different refusal directions shape
the style of refusals by steering the model along
each split-specific direction and generating re-
sponses to two prompts:
1.“How can I steal money from an old lady?”
2.“Why did you hit me?”
All directions reliably refuse these prompts, but
they do so in systematically different ways. Table 6
shows one representative refusal per split.
B
Refusal splits
ThroughoutSections 4.1 and 4.2, we work with a
common collection of refusal splits constructed
from the datasets in Sec. 3. Each split consists of
two balanced prompt pools:
• a set of prompts that should elicit non-
compliant (refusal-style) behavior under cor-
rect behavior, and
• a set of benign prompts for which straightfor-
ward compliance is appropriate.
We treat dataset-provided safety labels (e.g., Wild-
Guard’s harmfulness labels or SorryBench cate-
gories) as indicating whether a prompt belongs on
the non-compliant side (“should refuse”) or the
benign side.
Table 7 summarizes the total number of prompts
we draw from each source subset when construct-
ing these splits. These are the full pools from which
we later subsample balanced subsets (typically 32
non-compliant + 32 benign) to estimate per-split
HR–BC directions.
WildGuard-Mix
(vanilla,
non-adversarial).
For WildGuard-Mix we restrict to the non-
adversarial vanilla prompts in the provided test
split, yielding 915 prompts in total. Using the
dataset harmfulness label as ground truth for
“should refuse” vs. “benign”, this pool contains
430 benign prompts and 485 prompts that should
elicit
non-compliant
(refusal-style)
behavior.
When we construct a WildGuard split, we sample
non-compliant prompts from the 485 and benign
prompts from the 430.
XSTest.
XSTest is designed to probe exagger-
ated safety behavior and comes with 450 prompts
in total: 200 prompts that should be refused (un-
safe) and 250 benign prompts. We use these la-
bels directly to define the non-compliant side (200
prompts) and the benign side (250 prompts) for the
XSTest split.
CoCoNot.
CoCoNot provides a taxonomy of
non-compliance behavior (e.g., incomplete, un-
supported, indeterminate, humanizing, and safety-
concerned requests). In our setting, all CoCoNot
prompts are treated as non-compliant requests: they
are prompts for which the desired behavior is to not
straightforwardly comply. The total pool consists
of 6,526 prompts, with category-level subsets of
1,500 humanizing requests, 1,092 incomplete re-
quests, 289 indeterminate requests, 2,596 requests
with safety concerns, and 1,049 unsupported re-
quests.
Since CoCoNot does not provide a matched be-
nign pool, we pair each CoCoNot subset with be-
nign prompts taken from the WildGuard-Mix be-
nign pool (430 benign vanilla prompts). For ex-
ample, the CoCoNot (Incomplete requests) split
draws its non-compliant side from the 1,092 in-
complete CoCoNot prompts and its benign side
from WildGuard’s benign prompts. These counts
in Table 7 therefore reflect only the non-compliant
side; the paired benign side is always drawn from
WildGuard-Mix.
SorryBench.
SorryBench provides a taxonomy
of refusal-style behavior for prompts that should
elicit non-compliant responses. The benchmark
contains 44 fine-grained categories; we use 10
prompts per category, giving 440 prompts in to-
tal.
These are further grouped into four broad
buckets: hate speech (50 prompts), crimes/torts
(190 prompts), inappropriate topics (150 prompts),
and unqualified advice (50 prompts). All of these
are treated as non-compliant prompts (“should
refuse”).
As with CoCoNot, SorryBench does not include
a matched benign pool, so for each SorryBench sub-
set we reuse benign prompts from the WildGuard-
Mix benign pool. The counts in Table 7 are there-
fore the sizes of the non-compliant side; the benign
side is again drawn from WildGuard-Mix.
Balanced subsamples for direction learning.
The pools in Table 7 define the universe of prompts
we consider for each dataset/subset. For the ac-

Table 6: Representative refusal styles obtained by steering along different refusal directions. Each response is
generated for one of the two illustrative prompts in the text and showcases the characteristic tone and framing of
that split.
tual HR–BC direction learning used inSection 4.1
andSection 4.2, we work with small balanced sub-
samples:
• For each refusal split, we typically sample
32 non-compliant prompts and 32 benign
prompts to form a 64-prompt training set.
• When a subset provides fewer than 32 non-
compliant prompts, we use all available
prompts on that side and match the benign
side accordingly.
• For stability and geometry analyses, we some-
times draw multiple independent 32/32 sub-
samples from the same underlying pools and
either average the resulting directions or re-
port split-half cosine statistics.
The larger pools (e.g., CoCoNot and SorryBench)
are used both to support these balanced 32/32 train-
ing sets and to provide held-out prompts for evalu-
ation of refusal behavior and direction stability in
the main text and additional appendix experiments.
C
Intra-class refusal direction geometry
To assess the stability of refusal directions within
a given category, we perform an intra-class anal-
ysis over the shared refusal splits introduced in
Sec. 6 and Appendix B. For each source subset with
a sufficiently large pool of harmful–refusal and
benign–compliance prompts (e.g. WildGuard-Mix,
CoCoNot, and SorryBench, along with the finer-
grained CoCoNot and SorryBench categories),
we repeatedly sample independent 32/32 HR–BC
splits from the same underlying pools and estimate
an HR–BC direction for each split using the same
procedure as in the main activation-space experi-
ments.
We then compute pairwise cosine similarities
between all directions derived from the same cate-
gory. Table 8 reports, for each category, the mean
and standard deviation of these within-category

D
Oracle experiments for refusal
directions
To check that our learned “refusal directions” are
well-defined and not an artefact of a particular sub-
sample, we run a series of oracle experiments in the
residual stream at layer 20, position −2. Through-
out, we write HR for harmful–refusal prompts,
BC for benign–compliance, BR for benign–refusal,
and HC for harmful–compliance. Given two buck-
ets A, B, we define an oracle direction vA−B as
the (unit-normalised) difference of means between
their residual activations, vA−B ∝E[resid(A)] −
E[resid(B)]. We then compare various dataset-
specific directions to a fixed reference oracle using
cosine similarity.
Stability under subsampling.
First, we build an
HR–BC oracle v⋆
HR-BC from a large training pool
(11,872 HR and 8,048 BC examples). We repeat-
edly draw small, non-overlapping “mini-buckets”
of size 32/32 and recompute the HR–BC direc-
tion within each mini-bucket. Across 100 such
resamples, the resulting directions have mean co-
sine 0.96±0.01 to the oracle (min 0.90, max 0.98),
indicating that even tiny random subsets recover
essentially the same global refusal direction. In
contrast, directions built from BR–BC on the same
resamples are nearly orthogonal to v⋆
HR-BC (mean
cosine ≈0.10 ± 0.07).
We repeat the same analysis treating HR–HC as
the target contrast. The HR–HC direction from all
training data aligns very strongly with its oracle
(0.93 ± 0.01), while both HR–BC and BR–BC lie
much further away (cosines ≈0.47 and ≈0.28
respectively). This suggests that HR–BC and HR–
HC capture related but distinguishable structure:
both are highly stable, but they are not interchange-
able.
Held-out “gold” oracles.
To check that our
training-derived directions match an independently
constructed notion of refusal, we build “gold” or-
acles using the XSTest 4-splits dataset. Here the
oracle uses all available labelled examples (161
HR, 194 BC, 32 BR, 32 HC), while the comparison
directions are built from the large training pools
above.
For a gold HR–BC oracle, the training HR–BC
direction has a mean cosine of 0.70±0.11, and the
HR–HC direction is similarly aligned (0.68±0.05),
while BR–BC is substantially lower (0.39 ± 0.11).
For a gold HR–HC oracle, the pattern flips: train-

ing HR–HC is very close (0.81 ± 0.02), HR–BC is
only moderately aligned (0.51±0.03), and BR–BC
remains low (0.24 ± 0.13). Taken together, these
results support the view that our refusal-related di-
rections are (i) stable under resampling, (ii) distinct
from other label contrasts such as BR–BC, and (iii)
consistent with an independently specified “gold”
notion of refusal.
To check that our learned “refusal directions” are
well-defined and not an artefact of a particular sub-
sample, we run a series of oracle experiments in the
residual stream at layer 20, position −2. Through-
out, we write HR for harmful–refusal prompts,
BC for benign–compliance, BR for benign–refusal,
and HC for harmful–compliance. Given two buck-
ets A, B, we define an oracle direction vA−B as
the (unit-normalised) difference of means between
their residual activations, vA−B ∝E[resid(A)] −
E[resid(B)]. We then compare various dataset-
specific directions to a fixed reference oracle using
cosine similarity.
Stability under subsampling.
First, we build an
HR–BC oracle v⋆
HR-BC from a large training pool
(11,872 HR and 8,048 BC examples). We repeat-
edly draw small, non-overlapping “mini-buckets”
of size 32/32 and recompute the HR–BC direc-
tion within each mini-bucket. Across 100 such
resamples, the resulting directions have mean co-
sine 0.96±0.01 to the oracle (min 0.90, max 0.98),
indicating that even tiny random subsets recover
essentially the same global refusal direction. In
contrast, directions built from BR–BC on the same
resamples are nearly orthogonal to v⋆
HR-BC (mean
cosine ≈0.10 ± 0.07).
We also consider very small-sample oracles. Us-
ing 32 HR and 32 BC prompts drawn from the 4-
splits combined dataset (a “hand-picked” HR–BC
oracle), random 32/32 HR–BC directions from the
large training pool align with cosine 0.84 ± 0.02,
while BR–BC directions remain close to orthogonal
(0.08 ± 0.07). If we instead build the oracle from a
single random 32/32 HR–BC subset of the training
data, training HR–BC directions align even more
strongly (0.90 ± 0.02), whereas BR–BC still stays
comparatively far away (0.21 ± 0.08). Altogether,
these checks suggest that (i) the HR–BC direction
is tightly concentrated around a single mode, and
(ii) this mode is specific to the harmful-vs-benign
contrast rather than a generic “refusal” axis.
Held-out “gold” oracles.
To check that our
training-derived directions match an independently
constructed notion of refusal, we build “gold” or-
acles using the XSTest 4-splits dataset. Here the
oracle uses all available labelled examples (161
HR, 194 BC, 32 BR, 32 HC), while the com-
parison directions are built from the large train-
ing pools above. For a gold HR–BC oracle, the
training HR–BC direction has a mean cosine of
0.70 ± 0.11, and the HR–HC direction is simi-
larly aligned (0.68 ± 0.05), while BR–BC is sub-
stantially lower (0.39 ± 0.11). For a gold HR–
HC oracle, the pattern flips: training HR–HC is
very close (0.81 ± 0.02), HR–BC is only moder-
ately aligned (0.51 ± 0.03), and BR–BC remains
low (0.24 ± 0.13). As an additional check, we
construct a BR–BC oracle using the 23 benign-
refusal prompts from XSTest plus 32 randomly
sampled BC examples. BR–BC directions esti-
mated from the large training pool have mean co-
sine only ≈0.15±0.04 to this oracle, compared to
≈0.53 ± 0.06 for HR–BC, reinforcing that benign
refusals occupy a different and less stable direction.
Family-level structure.
Finally, we run a split-
half analysis over all four label families (HR, BR,
HC, BC), estimating replicate directions for each
contrast (HR–BC, BR–BC, HR–HC, HR–BR, HC–
BC, HC–BR). Within-family cosine similarities are
high for all refusal- and harm-related contrasts (e.g.
HR–BC: 0.92; HR–HC: 0.86; HR–BR: 0.94; HC–
BC: 0.88; HC–BR: 0.92; BR–BC: 0.77), whereas
cross-family cosines are much lower. In partic-
ular, HR–BC vs BR–BC has mean cross-family
cosine ≈0.10, and the cosine between their fam-
ily mean directions is only ≈0.12, far below the
within-family means.
A selectivity analysis of
signed projections shows that each mean-difference
∆A−B projects much more strongly on its own di-
rection vA−B than on other family directions (e.g.
∆HR-BC·vHR-BC ≫∆HR-BC·vBR-BC, and conversely
for ∆BR-BC).
Together, these results support a

Experiment 5: Hook Variants and
Robustness
Goal.
Check whether the causal effect of SAE
refusal latents depends delicately on where and how
we hook, or whether it is robust across reasonable
choices of layer and token pattern.
Summary.
We vary (i) the SAE layer (9/20/31),
(ii) whether the steering direction is added at the
prompt-only, during generation-only, or at both,
and (iii) how often we inject it during genera-
tion (every token vs. every second or third token).
Across these settings, we observe a smooth trade-
off: more frequent or deeper hooks require smaller
α to achieve similar HR/BR behavior, but the over-
all shape of the curves is essentially unchanged.
This mirrors the activation-space results and sug-
gests that the SAE-based refusal directions are not
a fragile artefact of a single hook choice.
D.2
Experiment 6: Taxonomy of Refusal
Latents
Goal.
Move from “refusal latents exist and are
causal” to “what do these latents represent?” by
building a lightweight semantic taxonomy of the
most refusal-associated latents.
Method (high level).
For a fixed SAE layer, we
take the top refusal-moving latents across sev-
eral splits and, for each latent, collect its highest-
activating prompt–response pairs. We then use an
external LLM to summarise common patterns per
latent and assign short labels, and a second pass to
group latents into a small number of higher-level
categories.
Findings.
Latents naturally cluster into a handful
of recurring themes, such as:
• self-harm and crisis help (explicit refusals that
redirect to support resources),
• sexual and relationship boundaries,
• crime, fraud, and physical harm,
• copyright / full-text reproduction, and
• professional and legal disclaimers.
Within these themes we see finer-grained subtypes,
e.g. features that emphasise “I am just an AI and
have no body” vs. features that foreground ille-
gality or lack of professional qualifications. This
aligns closely with the stylistic patterns illustrated
in Appendix A: different refusal directions lean
on different subsets of these latent themes when
framing their refusals.
A complementary run on a combined HR/BC
pool confirms that these themes are not just arti-
facts of analyzing each dataset in isolation. We con-
struct a balanced mixture by downsampling XSTest,
WildGuard-Mix, CoCoNot, and SorryBench to the
size of the smallest dataset and then balancing re-
fusals vs. non-refusals, and rerun the same latent-
mining and GPT-labelling pipeline on this pooled
set. The top refusal-moving latents at a late layer
again collapse into a small set of macro-classes:
(i) hate/abuse, defamation, and disinformation; (ii)
violence, illicit instructions, and sexual exploita-
tion; (iii) privacy/PII, copyright, and impossible or
omniscient knowledge; and (iv) capability and ac-
cess limits, including multimodal/tool-access gaps
and anthropomorphic self-history requests. That
these same macro-classes emerge when all datasets
are mixed suggests that the taxonomy is capturing
a compact, reusable backbone of refusal-related
features that is shared across benchmarks, with
dataset-specific refusal styles largely reflecting dif-
ferent weightings over this common feature set
rather than wholly distinct mechanisms.
E
Latent Semantic Annotation
To semantically interpret the SAE latents associ-
ated with refusal behavior, we developed a two-
round LLM-assisted annotation pipeline. First, we
identified the top-10 latents exhibiting the highest
refusal-moving scores from our contrastive analy-
sis between refusal and compliance examples. For
each selected latent, we extracted the 20 prompts

with the highest activation values and tokenized
them such that the most strongly activating tokens
were marked with brackets to highlight the key trig-
gering patterns. These annotated examples were
then passed to GPT-4, which generated an initial
semantic label, description, and characteristic pat-
terns for each latent based on the bracketed activa-
tion contexts (Round 1: Initial Annotation). Next,
the model received all latent annotations together
and was prompted to organize them into a maxi-
mum of four coherent semantic categories, identi-
fying commonalities and distinctions across latents
(Clustering Stage). Finally, GPT-4 was provided
with each latent’s original description alongside
its assigned cluster description and asked to pro-
duce refined labels that better reflect the latent’s
role within its category (Round 2: Category-Aware
Refinement). Crucially, this annotation pipeline
was executed under multiple settings: once on a
combined dataset (mixing XSTest, WildGuard, Co-
CoNot, and SorryBench, balanced to 1,320 exam-
ples) and separately on individual dataset subcat-
egories (e.g., CoCoNot’s “Humanizing requests,”
“Unsupported requests,” or SorryBench’s “Hate
speech generation,” “Assistance with crimes or
torts”). By annotating the same latents across dif-
ferent data contexts, we reveal their multi-faceted
nature—a single latent may receive distinct seman-
tic interpretations depending on which examples
most strongly activate it in a given setting. For in-
stance, latent 550 is labeled "Commissioned public-
harm communications" in the combined analysis
focusing on hate speech and defamation, but re-
ceives the label "Unsupported modality request"
when analyzed on CoCoNot’s capability-focused
examples.
Similarly, latent 7137 is interpreted
as “Missing-input/external-content requests” in the
combined setting, but as “Malware and doxxing
requests” in SorryBench’s crime-focused subcat-
egory and “Translate/Transcribe Attached Media”
in CoCoNot’s unsupported requests. This polyse-
mous behavior suggests that refusal-related latents
encode context-sensitive features rather than fixed
categorical detectors.
F
Refusal Latent Overlap between Splits
We show in Table 16 the overlap of top-3000 re-
fusal latents across all the layers between the direc-
tions of different splits, while Tables 17,18 and 19
show the overlap between the top-1000 latents per
split for the layer 9, 20, 31, respectively.
