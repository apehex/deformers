Solving increasingly complex problems with large language models (LLMs) necessitates a move beyond
individual models and towards multi-model systems that can effectively collaborate. While text has
traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange
is possible if models can access each other’s internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a
shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth
channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by aug-
menting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of
experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-
model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared
space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models.
Our work represents a significant step towards a future where models can fluidly share knowledge and
capabilities.

1. Introduction
As the abilities of frontier large language models
(LLMs) continue to expand, our community is
rapidly producing many models with a diverse
range of both generalist and domain-specific
capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery
et al., 2023; Comanici et al., 2025). This growing
pool of models presents both an opportunity and
a challenge: how can we effectively orchestrate
these individual models to solve problems that
are beyond the scope of any single one? Such col-
laboration between models can take two primary
forms. The first is multi-model systems, such as
LLM agents (Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024),
model cascades (Kolawole et al., 2024; Yue et al.,
2023), model frankensteins (Akiba et al., 2025)
and mixture-of-expert models (Filippova et al.,
2024). The second is skill reuse (Sabry and Belz,
2024), where modules or knowledge from one
model – like soft prompts (Lester et al., 2021)
or prefix k-v caches (Li and Liang, 2021) – are
shared and leveraged by others.
Towards the north-star of seamless inter-model
collaboration (Kandpal et al., 2023), we provide
evidence showing the feasibility of allowing mod-
els to read and write to each other’s key-value (k-
v) cache latent space. A transformer’s (Vaswani
et al., 2017) k-v cache is a rich, natural repre-
sentation of its internal state. A sufficiently high
dimensional cache vector space could allow for
much higher communication bandwidth between
models than token-level text exchange (Hao
et al., 2024; Moschella et al., 2022). By accessing
each other’s latent space, models could directly
read each others’ state and extract relevant
knowledge, follow (soft) reasoning chains, and
reuse partial computations or skills, leading to a
more efficient collaboration on challenging tasks.
Unfortunately, even given the same input text,
we cannot expect the latent spaces of two mod-
els trained under different conditions to be in-
terchangeable (Ainsworth et al., 2022). This is
because any given token passing through a model
creates conditional dependencies on the k-v space
of the layer(s) before it, causing the discrepancies
in latent space between any pair of models with
different parameters to compound with depth
(Friedman et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2020).

tion literature (Lu et al., 2018; Richens, 1956),

Latent Space Communication via K-V Cache Alignment
Figure 1 | Overview of an example instantiation
of our framework. [Upper] Each model (here
Russian and Spanish LMs) is augmented with
adapters for translating a k-v cache block into
and out of the shared latent space. E.g Es-Out
translates a k-v cache out of the Es model’s latent
space and into the shared space. [Lower] We can
perform mixed language modelling (for context
switching settings), by translating generated pre-
fix caches from a source model and continuing to
decode from the target model.
given a set of models with possibly disjoint latent
spaces, we propose to learn a global, shared k-
v cache representation space that any model in
the pool can read from and write to. Specifically,
we augment each model with two adapters: one
for translating its k-v cache block into the shared
representation space, and another for translating
a given shared space cache block into its model-
specific latent space (Figure 1). As designed, this
is an implicit (shared) latent space and presents
a scalable communication channel with param-
eter overhead that only grows linearly with the
number of models in the pool.
Through a battery of experiments on Gemma-
2 (Team-Gemma et al., 2024) open models, we
demonstrate that we can teach a set of language
models trained under a range of different condi-
tions to read and write to each other’s k-v cache
latent space. To achieve this, we provide a scal-
able architecture and efficient algorithm for learn-
ing a global latent space without modifying the
individual models’ pre-trained parameters. We
share the following findings:
1. Given a set of language models that differ
along axes such as size, training data dis-
tribution and random initialization, we are
able to learn a global shared k-v cache latent
representation space.
2. Given sufficient data for learning the global
latent space, we can improve the individual
models’ language modelling performance by
passing prefix k-v caches through the shared
space before modelling the suffix text.
3. A global shared latent space enables learned
modules to be portable between models.
Specifically, we conduct experiments where
soft-prompts, learned on a particular task for
one model, can be translated via our global
latent space, and used directly by another
model to perform the same task. This allows
modules learned by individual models to be-
come a shared resource of the whole pool.
2. Methodology
We enhance a pool of models with the ability
to read and write to each other’s k-v cache rep-
resentation spaces. By read, we mean a model
can translate from another’s k-v cache space into
its own, and write implies a model translating
its k-v cache into another model’s representation
space. We do so via a mechanism where individ-
ual model latent spaces are mediated by a learned
globally shared, but implicit, latent space. In this
section, we will detail our framework with archi-
tecture specifics and a learning algorithm.
2.1. Setup
Consider a pool of N models indexed as
{𝑚1, . . . , 𝑚𝑖, . . . , 𝑚𝑁}. We would like to learn a
shared latent space, Σ, amongst these models
parameterized as follows: for each model, we
learn a map T[𝑚𝑖→Σ] into the shared space and
another map T[Σ→𝑚𝑖] out of the space.
Thus,
assuming that we have the cache for model
𝑚𝑖, 𝐾𝑉𝑖
∈
R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×𝐷𝑖, our parameterization
instantiates T[𝑚𝑖→Σ] : R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×𝐷𝑖→R𝐵×𝑆×𝑄and
T[Σ→𝑚𝑖] : R𝐵×𝑆×𝑄→R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×𝐷𝑖. Where B, L, S, D
are batch, layer, sequence and model dimensions

respectively. For simplicity, we assume that all the
models in the pool share the same vocabulary and
so for a piece of text, 𝑆is the same for a for all mod-
els. Our method does not require this assumption,
but it is convenient for conveying a simple setup.
Though each model may have a different num-
ber of layers 𝐿𝑖and model dimension 𝐷𝑖, we map
all of them to a shared embedding space of fixed
size, 𝑄. The shared space therefore has no direct
layer-wise demarcation. Instead of forcing a pre-
specified assignment per-model, we leave it to the
output maps to learn to appropriately reconstruct
the layer demarcations. Each model’s map into
the global shared space mixes layer-wise infor-
mation (𝐿𝑖× 𝐷𝑖→𝑄) whilst the mapping out of
the shared space performs a model-specific recon-
struction of layer-wise information (𝑄→𝐿𝑖× 𝐷𝑖).
We prefer such a design because layers might not
have one-to-one correspondence across models of
different sizes and even if a pair of models have
the same number of layers, it is not guaranteed
that they map directly to each other due to the
presence of residual connections (Nguyen et al.,
2020).
We highlight that each model has an adapter
1 into and an adapter out of the shared space.
Since the shared space is global, once a model
translates into the shared space, that latent rep-
resentation can be translated into the local latent
space of any of the other models using the corre-
sponding adapter (including the original model
itself). This ensures that the number of parame-
ters required to learn a shared space only grows
linearly as the number of models. Another ad-
vantage of this design is that it is easy to incor-
porate new models into the pool. Adding a new
model, 𝑚𝑘, would simply involve learning the pair
T[𝑚𝑘→Σ] and T[Σ→𝑚𝑘] whilst keeping the maps of
all the other models (and the shared space itself,
Σ) fixed.
2.2. Translator Architecture
Given that the relationship between k-v caches
of different models may be highly non-linear, we
parameterize the transformations into and out
1We will use the terms adapter, mapping and translator
interchangeably
Figure 2 | Cross attention architecture for map-
ping into and out of the shared latent space. The
first layer k-or-v cache serves as seed input to the
model. Each layer in the module cross-attends to
the corresponding layer in the input k-or-v (not
both at the same time) block, meaning that the
number of layers in the translator is equal to the
number of layers in the corresponding model. We
use the superscript ∗to represent vectors in Σ.
of the shared embedding space with multi-layer
transformer models. For any model 𝑚𝑖in our pool,
we use the same high level architecture for both
T[𝑚𝑖→Σ] and T[Σ→𝑚𝑖]:
1. Input Transformation: Consider an input
cache block (either key or value) 𝐾𝑉. For
T[𝑚𝑖→Σ], this block will have dimensions
𝐾𝑉local ∈R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×𝐷𝑖but for T[Σ→𝑚𝑖], which
receives a block from the global shared space,
𝐾𝑉global ∈R𝐵×𝑆×𝑄. To keep the architecture
symmetric we perform a pre-processing step
of reshaping R𝐵×𝑆×𝑄→R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×(𝑄//𝐿𝑖) when
translating from global to local space with
T[Σ→𝑚𝑖]. This requires adding a constraint
that {∀𝐿∈𝐿𝑖, 𝑄mod 𝐿= 0} so the global
space is the same dimension for all models.
We now apply a simple non-linear transfor-
mation consisting of a layer-normalization
(Ba et al., 2016), linear transform and a
GELU activation (Hendrycks and Gimpel,
2016). The resulting intermediate result has
dimensions R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×𝐷′
𝑖where 𝐷′
𝑖is the output
dimension of the linear transform. 2 Note
2Our choice of linear transform preserves 𝐿𝑖but we are

that we differentiates between key and value
caches by using different sets of parameters
for the linear transform.
2. Cross Attention: The main workhorse of the
latent space adapter is the cross attention
module. Figure 2 is a pictorial representa-
tion of the architecture. Using this layer-
wise cross-attention architecture allows us
to model the hierarchical process that gener-
ated the k-v cache block in the first place. For
this module, we share parameters between
key and value type cache input blocks. At a
given layer, we use the output of the previ-
ous layer to generate the query vector whilst
the key and value vectors are generated by
the corresponding k/v cache designated for
cross-attention.
3. Output Transformation: We concatenate
the outputs of the cross-attention layers to-
gether (along the last dimension) to ob-
tain R𝐵×𝑆×(𝐿𝑖×𝐷′
𝑖) and pass this through
a non-linear output transformation (exact
same structure as input transformation de-
scribed above) to output a cache block in
R𝐵×𝑆×(𝐿𝑖×𝐷𝑖). This is then reshaped to pro-
duce 𝐾𝑉local ∈R𝐵×𝑆×𝐿𝑖×𝐷𝑖as the final output.
2.3. Learning Algorithm
We explore two losses to provide signal for learn-
ing the global shared latent space.
2.3.1. Reconstruction Loss
We consider a reconstruction loss for converting
the k-v cache of one model to another. Let 𝐾𝑉𝑥
denote a model’s k-v cache corresponding to a
piece of text, x.
Lrecon =
∑︁
𝑚𝑖,𝑚𝑗
T[Σ→𝑚𝑗] T[𝑚𝑖→Σ](𝐾𝑉𝑖
𝑥) −𝐾𝑉𝑗
𝑥
2
The equation above shows a translation between
models 𝑚𝑖and 𝑚𝑗which passes through the
Σ only once.
In theory, we can also have
chains of translations in and out of the shared
space (T[Σ→𝑚𝑗] . . . T[𝑚𝑙]→Σ ⊙T[Σ→𝑚𝑙] ⊙T[𝑚𝑙−1]→Σ ⊙
free to expand or contract 𝐿𝑖→˜𝐿𝑖. Using ˜𝐿𝑖< 𝐿𝑖can
reduce the latency of running the adapter but at the cost of
expressiveness.
T[Σ→𝑚𝑙−1] . . . T[𝑚𝑖→Σ]) linking the two models at
the ends of the chain. However, back propaga-
tion through this loss would be computationally
expensive.
2.3.2. Suffix Language Modelling
Even small reconstruction errors can cascade
into large prediction errors.
Also, an exact
reconstruction of the target model’s k-v cache
means that we are upper bounded by its orig-
inal language modelling performance.
Since
we are primarily concerned with language mod-
els, we propose a suffix language modelling loss
that conditions on a prefix k-v cache translated
from another model. Specifically, given a text
sequence, x, of length 𝜏, and a source-target
model pair (𝑚𝑖, 𝑚𝑗), we use our cache-translation
on an 𝑠-length chunk of generated k-v cache:
𝐾𝑉𝑖→𝑗
𝑥[:𝑠] = T[Σ→𝑚𝑗] T[𝑚𝑖→Σ](𝐾𝑉𝑖
𝑥[:𝑠]). We then use
this chunk as a prefix for language modelling the
remaining 𝜏-s tokens by the target model:
LLM =
∑︁
𝑚𝑖,𝑚𝑗
𝐶𝐸

𝑥[𝑠:𝜏], 𝑚𝑗
𝐾𝑉𝑖→𝑗
𝑥[:𝑆]

[𝑠→𝜏]

CE is the cross entropy loss and 𝑚𝑗
 · 
[𝑠→𝜏] is
the 𝜏-s length suffix output of model 𝑚𝑗given
an input k-v cache prefix. Note that since each
model involved in the suffix language modelling
loss operates on disjoint sections of the text, we
can apply it to models that have different vocabu-
laries. However, the reconstruction loss can not
be directly applied to models with disjoint vo-
cabularies unless we a-priori define a mapping
between the two vocabularies.
3. Experimental Setting
Pre-trained Models: For our experiments, we
pre-train a range of Gemma-2 (Team-Gemma
et al., 2024) models of sizes between 100M-400M
parameters (not counting the token embeddings).
For all our experiments, we keep the pre-trained
models frozen and only learn the adapters into
and out of the latent space. We use the multi-
lingual C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2019) with a
maximum sequence length of 512 tokens per ex-
ample sequence. Unless otherwise specified, we
4

## Page 5

focus on the English, Russian and Spanish splits
of this dataset for all our experiments.
Adapter architecture Details: For the adapters
into the shared space, we use the Gemma-2
architecture but modify it to allow for cross-
attention. We fix the number of heads to 32 and
head dimension to 64 for all experiments. Two
hyper-parameters control the size of the adapter
models (since it has the same number of lay-
ers as the base model): embed_dim_factor (=
𝐷′
𝑖
𝐷𝑖) and translation_dim_factor (by what
factor the fully connected layers expand the
residual stream dimensionality). For all exper-
iments except when we are ablating the adapter
model size, we set embed_dim_factor = 2 and
translation_dim_factor = 1. This gener-
ally results in each translator being ∼1
4 the base
model size.
Training the translator:
We train for 50k
steps using learning rate warmup for 2.5k (5%)
steps and cosine decay learning rate schedule
(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2016). The initial learn-
ing rate value is set to 1𝑒−6 before warmup
and it is eventually decayed to 0.0 at the end
of the training. We use the AdamW optimizer
(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with the default
hyper-parameters in Optax (Hessel et al., 2020)
except for the learning rate which we sweep over
in the set [1𝑒−3, 1𝑒−4, 1𝑒−5]. All gradient norms
were clipped to 1.0 before being applied. Dur-
ing training, we sweep batch sizes in the range
[256, 512, 1024]. Unless otherwise specified, our
experiments use the first 128 tokens as prefix and
the remaining as suffix for generation with the
target model.
4. Models can be taught to communi-
cate via a global k-v latent space
Using our framework, we design a series of exper-
iments to show that it is possible to teach a set of
models (that share the same token vocabulary) to
cooperate by leveraging a global shared k-v latent
space. We consider two main kinds of model sets:
models that are fine-tuned or adapted from the
same origin and a set of models that have entirely
disjoint training trajectories. For all our experi-
ments in this section, unless otherwise specified,
we use only the suffix language modelling loss.
4.1. Same trajectory, different checkpoints
We train a 200M model on a mixed language
distribution of 50% English, and 25% each of
Spanish and Russian till Chinchilla optimal (Hoff-
mann et al., 2022). We take 2 checkpoints – the
last checkpoint and a checkpoint in the middle
of training. We consider the former model as a
“stronger” checkpoint and primarily seek to im-
prove the language modelling performance on
the earlier checkpoint. Since the training trajec-
tory of the earlier checkpoint is entirely contained
in the last, we posit that their k-v latent spaces
should be highly related, and translating between
these models should be reasonably easy.
Figure 3a shows the results of this experiment.
We see an improvement beyond the base model
performance when the prefix k-v cache is the out-
put of the global shared space. We posit that the
latent space sharpens the relevant k-v cache fea-
tures in a way that improves the end model’s task
performance. We observe this improvement even
in the case where we do a cyclic translation of the
model’s prefix-kv cache into the global space and
back into its local latent space. Figure 3a also
suggests that it takes less data to learn a transla-
tion from the stronger model’s k-v cache space to
the weaker model’s, as indicated by the training
step at which using the global k-v space matches
or improves upon the base model performance.
4.2. Same origin model, different fine-tuning
distributions
We produce two expert models, one in Russian
(trained on 100% Russian data) and another in
Spanish (trained on 100% Spanish data) that
are branched from the same parent model: the
last checkpoint model from Section 4.1 which
was trained on the specified mixed language
distribution.
We created a Russian-Spanish parallel dataset
for this experiment using the English C4 dataset
as the pivot source. Using publicly available Gem-
ini API call, we translated a subset of the English
text into Russian and Spanish. By pairing the cor-
responding translations from each language, we
formed a direct Russian-Spanish parallel corpus
with 10M pairs for the training set and an 800K
5

(a) We can improve the performance (on language
modelling text suffixes) of two models that are dif-
ferent checkpoints of the same training trajectory by
translating prefixes through the global latent-space.
All curves are comparable to each other since the eval
sets are the same.
(b) We take the same checkpoint and fine-tune it on
different data distributions to produce expert models
in Russian and Spanish. We are able to learn a global
latent-space between these two models. Only curves
of the same color are comparable since each language
has a different eval set.
(c) Our method works with pools of models that have
different random initialization. We see that all our
paths come close to or surpass the base models per-
formances.
(d) The 400M model has 4× more layers and is trained
on more data than the 100M model. Our framework
allows this pair of models to collaborate on the lan-
guage modelling task despite these differences.
Figure 3 | We can learn a shared latent space between different models with different degrees of
overlap in their training trajectories. Evaluation loss is negative log likelihood on held-out text.
pairs for the evaluation set.
To illustrate the setup, suppose we are using
Russian as the target language and Spanish as the
source language. We pass a prefix of Spanish text
to the Spanish language expert to obtain a prefix
cache, and then generate the Russian suffix text
with the Russian language expert after translating
the (prefix) cache through the global latent space
into the Russsian expert’s latent space. We do
very weak alignment of the parallel text – we
simply skip the first prefix-length-tokens in the
target language and continue decoding.
Though this setting represents a more extreme
latent space divergence than we have in Section
4.1, our approach is similarly capable of learn-
ing a good shared latent space as Figure 3b in-
dicates. Again, when trained on enough data,
cyclicly translating a prefix k-v cache through the
latent space can actually outperform decoding
using the model’s untouched k-v cache.

4.3. Same data distribution but different ran-
dom initialization
For the above sections, the training trajectories of
the model pool have had non-zero overlap. Next,
we investigate pools that share no trajectory over-
lap, but are trained on the same data distribution.
We use 3 100M models trained on the same mixed
language distribution as in Section 4.1 but initial-
ize each model with different random seeds.
We use a prefix length of 64 tokens and se-
quence length of 128 for these experiments since
3 models presents a higher memory overhead. As
in previous sections, even though these models
do not share training trajectories, we are still able
to teach them to leverage each other’s k-v caches
(Figure 3c).
4.4. Different Model Sizes
Figure 3d shows that we are able to translate the k-
v caches of models of different sizes. Specifically,
though the 400M model has 16 layers whilst the
100M model has 4 layers, our adapters are able
to learn an appropriate mapping. Similar to the
earlier experiments in this section, we are able
to improve the performance of the weaker 100M
model by using prefix k-v caches translated from
the stronger 400M model. Note that the two
models have disjoint training trajectories not only
because of different random initialization, but
also due to different amounts of training data
(since they are both trained Chinchilla-optimally
and thus the 400M is trained with more data than
the 100M model).
5. The global k-v latent space is exten-
sible
A desirable property of the global latent space
is that it is easily extensible when new mod-
els are added to the pool – without necessarily
having to retrain the adapters. In this section,
we demonstrate that our framework possesses
this property. We use the experiment in Sec-
tion 4.3 as a scaffold and introduce a 4th model
(Seed-4) trained with a different seed. We learn
the pairs T[Seed-4→Σ], T[Σ→Seed-4] whilst keep-
ing the global latent-space adapters of Seed-{1,
Figure 4 | We extend a pool of 3 models with
different seeds-{1, 2, 3} with a fourth model.
Solid lines mark translation paths that were
not trained on. Without explicitly training on a
these translation paths, we are still able to zero-
shot translate the between the k-v caches of the
two models – seeds-{1, 4} – with only mild per-
formance degradation compared to fully trained
paths.
2, 3} fixed.
Our results are shown in Figure 4. Note that
during training, we only use the paths involving
Seed-{2, 3} to learn the latent-space adapters
for Seed-4. Though we never train on the paths
Seed-4 →Seed-1 and Seed-1 →Seed-4,
we are able to zero-shot translate between the
two models, achieving comparable performance
relative to paths that were explicitly trained on.
This demonstrates that the original latent space
learned using Seed-{1, 2, 3} is indeed global
– cache blocks from different models translated
into the shared latent-space are reasonably in-
distinguishable from each other, thus allowing
arbitrary source-target translation paths once a
new model learns adapters into the space. Gener-
alization to unseen paths would not be possible if
the shared latent-space was path-wise segmented
or delineated by model.
Our results in this section also demonstrate that
as the size of the pool grows, we may not need
all the existing models in the pool to learn the
translator for incoming models. This reduces the
memory and compute overhead of extending the
pool to new models.

6. A global k-v latent space enables
module portability
An implication of having a shared k-v latent-space
is that learned task specific modules that mani-
fest as k-v caches (like prefix-tuning Li and Liang
(2021); and soft-prompts Lester et al. (2021)) can
become a shared resource across models. A mod-
ule trained for one model to perform a specific
task can be translated into the k-v cache space
of any of the other models in the pool, making
those task specific skills accessible to all models
without per-model training.
Such module portability is desirable for several
reasons. First, the computational cost of learn-
ing a skill is amortized across all the models in
the pool. We do not have to train a module for
each model since we learn the module once and
then translate it into the k-v cache space of the
remaining models when needed. The saved com-
pute can be redirected to expand the pool of skills
instead. Next, module portability enhances data
privacy. Only one model needs to be directly ex-
posed to the task data but the resulting module
can be used by all other models. Stronger privacy
guarantees can be achieved if the original mod-
ule is trained via differential privacy (Abadi et al.,
2016; Dwork, 2006).
6.1. Setup
We investigate module portability by running
meta-learning experiments on the prompt recov-
ery task. The prompt recovery task is defined
as follows: given a list of k sequences of text,
{𝑥1 . . . 𝑥𝑘}, corresponding to completions from
a prompted LLM: 𝑥𝑖∼𝑚(· | C), we wish to re-
cover the context prompt, C by learning a soft
prompt (Lester et al., 2021), P ∈ℝ𝑝×𝐷such that
𝑚(· | [P]) ≈𝑚(· | C). P should generalize to a
held out set of example completions as measured
by likelihood under the LLM. Since we learn P
without seeing C, we are learning to recover the
original prompt, but as soft-tokens, instead of
text. The prompt completion task is friendly to
investigating module portability since we can eas-
ily create many task instances, (C𝑗, {𝑥1 . . . 𝑥𝑘} 𝑗),
for training the shared latent-space.
We create a seed set of 65 human written
prompts 3 which we use to prompt Gemini-2.5
Flash to generate ∼6000 similar prompts. We
specify that the generated prompts should be di-
verse and span multiple domains. For each of
these 6k prompts, we use an instruction tuned
(Wei et al., 2021) Gemma-2 model to generate
300-800 possible completions of length 30-50
words of which 50 completions are used for eval-
uations. We use 5.8K prompt completion tasks as
meta-train and 200 tasks as the meta-test set.
We use the meta-train task to train (or fine-
tune) the latent-space adapters to be able to trans-
late the k-v cache of the learned soft-prompt from
the source to the target model. Given a translated
cache, we evaluate its loss on the validation set
on the target model (i.e zero-shot) and this loss is
used as learning signal for updating the adapters
into the shared global latent space. At test time,
we freeze all the translation and base-model pa-
rameters, learn a soft-prompt for each of the 200
meta-eval completion task on a source model and
evaluate the performance after zero-shot trans-
lating it into the latent-space of the target model.
6.2. Results
Figure 5 shows that we can learn to zero-shot port
modules that have been trained on one model
to be used by another model.
Our approach
performs significantly better than the lower
bound of using a random (untrained) soft-prompt
per-task on the target model. With only a few
thousand meta-train tasks,
our approaches
the upper bound performance of learning the
soft-prompt directly for each target model. We
posit that with more data, we can match and
possibly exceed this baseline performance since
our experiments featured in Figure 3 show that
the shared global-space can learn to generalize
beyond the base model performance.
Note from Figure 5 that it is beneficial to pre-
train the global latent space before fine-tuning on
the meta-train set. We get the best performance
by pre-training on the suffix language modelling
task without the reconstruction loss.

7. Ablations
7.1. Performance improves with shared space
adapter model size
We ablate the use of the multi-layer cross-
attention architecture introduced in Section 2.2.
We compare to an identity and linear mapping
as baselines. For the linear mapping, we have
separate maps for k- and v-caches respectively
which are applied to the layer-wise concatenated
k-v caches.
The results in Table 1 show that using an iden-
tity mapping (no learned parameters) yields poor
performance even though the two models differ
only in their random initialization. This map-
ping has the further disadvantage that it can only
be used when the models’ k-v cache dimensions
match exactly. It is interesting to see that that we
match or exceed the base model performance us-
ing a simple linear map. This is in line with recent
work like Lähner and Moeller (2024); Moschella
et al. (2022) that suggest that the geometries of
latent spaces of deep neural networks trained on
the same data distribution tend to be approxi-
mately equal modulo linear transformations. A
caveat of the results in Table 1 is that that the lin-
ear maps significantly expand the size of the k-v
cache dimension to create the shared latent-space
(upward projections of 8× and 24× respectively
for the 269M and 806M models).
Our translator outperforms the simple linear
map with fewer parameters. Unlike the linear
map, our cross-attention architecture exhibits de-
sirable scaling behavior: consistent improvement
in performance as we increase the size of the
latent-space adapters.
7.2. We do not need to see all all paths in a
single batch during training
For the learning objectives proposed in Section
2.3, we sum over multiple paths through the la-
tent space to compute the loss. The number of
possible paths is combinatorial in the number of
models in the pool. Thus, it would be computa-
9

## Page 10

Latent Space Communication via K-V Cache Alignment
Figure 6 | We can learn to align latent-spaces
without using all possible paths per-step during
training. More paths per-step is not unilaterally
better. For some translation directions, having 2
paths results in superior performance over 4.
tionally inadvisable, to consider all possible paths
during each step when training the shared latent
space.
For all our experiments with 2 models, we use
all the possible 4 paths during training. However,
instantiating 9 paths for training the latent space
for 3 models would be both slow and memory
intensive. We use the setup from Section 4.3 and
experiment with the impact of using significantly
fewer paths than possible for training. Figure 6
shows the results of our experiments – each point
is the minimum over a set of hyper-parameter
sweeps.
The average base performance of the 3 seed
models is 3.460 NLL (negative log-likelihood) on
the evaluation set. Even with 1 translation path
per step, we can learn a map that brings us close
to this baseline when we average over all 9 pos-
sible paths (3.53 NLL). When translating from
Seed-1,3 to other models, we get the best per-
formance using 2 paths per batch whilst 4 paths
work best for translating from Seed-2 to other
models. We posit that some amount of stochastic-
ity is important to achieve good generalization of
the learned latent space.
7.3. Reconstruction loss is unnecessary in the
presence of the suffix language modelling
loss
Many works in the space of latent space align-
ment use the reconstruction loss as a primary

objective (Jha et al., 2025; Lähner and Moeller,
2024). We however find that the presence of the
target task objective (in our case, language mod-
elling loss), obviates the need for the reconstruc-
tion loss. Thus, for all our primary results, we
excluded the reconstruction loss unless otherwise
explicitly stated.
8. Related Work
Many areas of machine learning are concerned
with solving complex problems by enabling effec-
tive communication between groups of models.
Recent works in using LLMs as agents feature
component models communicating with each at
a high level of abstraction via natural language
or structured data formats like JSON or query
language (Wang et al., 2024, 2023). In the fields
of multi-agent reinforcement learning (Gronauer
and Diepold, 2022) and emergent communica-
tion (Lazaridou and Baroni, 2020), the messages
passed between models usually take the form of
low dimensional vectors that connect the output
of one model to the input of another (Chaabouni
et al., 2022; Foerster et al., 2016; Lo et al., 2023;
Wu et al., 2025). Our framework provides higher
bandwidth communication channels and facili-
tates much stronger model collaboration by allow-
ing models to directly access each others’ internal
state in the form of the k-v cache latent spaces.
Our framework also has implications for coarse-
grained mixture of expert architectures like Di-
PaCo (Douillard et al., 2024) and Small-Talk (Fil-
ippova et al., 2024) where text generation pro-
ceeds by periodically switching between a set of
expert models. These architectures tend to in-
cur high inference latency due to the need to
re-compute the prefix k-v caches whenever the
router switches between models. By learning to
translate between the k-v cache spaces of the mod-
10

els in the ensemble, we can significantly reduce
the cost associated with naive recomputation of
the prefix cache per model.
Our research builds upon the foundational
work in latent space alignment, which seeks to
bridge the semantic gap between disparate, pre-
trained models (Jha et al., 2025; Maiorca et al.,
2023). Lähner and Moeller (2024) demonstrate
that direct linear transformations can effectively
map one model’s latent space to another’s, a find-
ing that makes the prospect of inter-model com-
munication computationally feasible. Similarly,
work on relative representations by Moschella
et al. (2022) provides a powerful method for zero-
shot composition, allowing modules from differ-
ent models to be combined without fine-tuning
by creating an invariant representational format.
The techniques in this area have largely been
applied to vision models and simpler architec-
tures like auto-encoders with the aim of statically
"stitching" together components from different
models. Our work proposes a different motiva-
tion for alignment – enabling dynamic, stateful
collaboration between models.
9. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a scalable and effec-
tive method for enabling direct latent space com-
munication between large language models by
learning a shared k-v cache representation space.
This approach not only bridges the gap between
incompatible models trained under various con-
ditions but also unlocks new benefits, including
improved performance and the ability to trans-
fer learned skills between models in a zero-shot
manner.
This work opens up many exciting avenues for
future research. An immediate next step is to
scale our framework to a larger, more hetero-
geneous pool of models, including those from
architectural families vastly different from those
explored in this work. While this work focused on
language modeling as a proof of concept, future
work should also explore more complex down-
stream tasks like agentic research (Lu et al., 2024)
and software engineering (Wang et al., 2024). Ul-
timately, this line of inquiry moves us closer to a
paradigm of seamless inter-model collaboration,
where the collective capabilities of diverse agents
can be harnessed to solve problems of unprece-
dented complexity.
